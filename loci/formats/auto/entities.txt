# This file enumerates the metadata entity and property definitions for the
# loci.formats.meta package, and loci.formats.ome.OMEXML*Metadata classes.

# Path key and syntax notes:
#
# 1) Path elements ending in plus (+) have maxOccurs > 1 and generate an
#    index parameter to allow differentiation between them.
#
# 2) Path elements beginning with at (@) are not direct children of the
#    previous element, but instead reference the parent via an ID reference.
#
# 3) Path elements beginning with at-bang (@!) also use a parent reference but
#    the API is slightly different -- e.g., for a LightSource accessing a
#    child Laser, the method is lightSource.getLaserListByLightSource()
#    rather than lightSource.getLaserList().
