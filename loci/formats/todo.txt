QuickTime:
* mjpb codec
* svq3 codec (lower priority)

Implement readers for other file formats:
* Amersham Biosciences GEL
* Fluoview FV1000 (OIB/OIF)
* DICOM
* Anything else listed online: http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/formats.html

Adapt VisBio to take advantage of LOCI Bio-Formats package.

Eventually (later) implement an alternative method for pixel extraction, other
than the BufferedImage one (such "byte[] openBytes(String, int)" in addition to
"BufferedImage openImage(String, int)"), for use with OMERO.
