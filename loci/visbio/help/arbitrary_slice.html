<html><body><h2>Arbitrary slices</h2>

<p>VisBio can slice through your image stack at an arbitrary orientation in 3D,
interpolating data along the slicing plane to create an "arbitrary slice." To
do it, first import your dataset as described in the
<a href="import_data.html">Importing a dataset from disk</a> topic. Select your
data from the list, then click the "Add &gt;" button and choose "Arbitrary
slice" from the popup menu.

<p>Choose a name for the arbitrary slice, and VisBio will create another data
object, a child of your original dataset, that represents the slice. To alter
the slice parameters, select the slice data object and click the "Edit" button.
A window similar to this one will appear:

<p>It is easiest to display the slice in 3D first before adjusting the
parameters. First, add your dataset to a 3D display as described in the
<a href="display_data.html">Displaying a data object</a> topic. Then add the
slice object to the same 3D display (not a new one). Doing so will overlay the
arbitrary slice on your image stack.

<p>Now when you adjust the slicing parameters, you can see the changes in real
time. Yaw and pitch adjust the orientation of the slicing line, while location
slides the slice itself forward and backward along the line.

<p>Resolution affects the quality of the computed slice (the higher the
resolution, the better it looks, but the more time it takes to compute). It is
recommended that you first orient the slice properly, then increase the
resolution for a better picture. You can speed up the yaw, pitch and location
adjustments even more by unchecking the "Recompute slice on the fly" option.

<p>Lastly, you can toggle the visibility of the guiding white slicing line with
the "Show white slicing line" option.
