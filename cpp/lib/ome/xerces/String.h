     * XMLCh *, as well as managing the memory of XMLCh * objects.
     * All Xerces functions and class methods which take XMLCh *
     * inputs may be transparently called with instances of this
     * class, and likewise functions and methods returning XMLCh * may
     * directly construct instances of this class using the return
     * value.
     *
     * This class does have an overhead of maintaining two copies of
     * the string (char * and XMLCh *), as well as the cost of
     * transcoding between the two forms upon construction.
     *
     * Assignment of std::string or XMLCh * is not supported.  This
     * class is only intended to transiently transcode between the two
     * types and manage the memory for this.
