 * @file endian.h Endian-specific integer types.  This header uses the
 * proposed Boost.Endian headers, which are not yet an official part of
 * any Boost release.
 *
 * @note Boost.Endian was imported from https://github.com/Beman/endian.git
 * commit d339470e6.  It should be replaced with the real Boost implementation
 * once it is included.  This is only included here as a workaround until
 * then.
