     * dumpXML(): Use ome::xerces::dom::writeDocument(doc, string);
     * writeXML(stream): Use ome::xerces::dom::writeDocument(doc, stream);

     * validateXML(doc): Use ome::xerces::dom::validate(doc)

     * XSLT transforms:
     * getStylesheet currently unimplemented.

     * Helpers:
     * checkUTF8: May not be required if xerces can handle it.
