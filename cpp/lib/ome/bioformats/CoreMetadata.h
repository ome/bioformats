     * `CoreMetadata copy(reader.getCoreMetadataList().at(index));`

     * getter methods that fill in missing CoreMetadata fields on the
     * fly (getThumbSizeX, getThumbSizeY) to avoid doing so -- one
     * alternate approach would be to have this class use getter
     * methods instead of public fields.
