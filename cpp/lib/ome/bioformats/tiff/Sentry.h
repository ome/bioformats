       * currently active TIFF/IFD.  The original state is restored
       * when destroyed.  Note that this exclusively locks all TIFF

       * block other threads.

       * to capture any errors which occur.  The latest error will be
       * available using getMessage().

       * will only exist transiently until the block ends.
