Bio-Formats is a standalone Java library for reading and writing life sciences
image file formats. It is capable of parsing both pixels and metadata for a
large number of formats, as well as writing to several formats.

If you are having an issue with Bio-Formats and need support, please see the
[support page](./SUPPORT.md).

Purpose
-------

Bio-Formats' primary purpose is to convert proprietary microscopy data into 
an open standard called the OME data model, particularly into the OME-TIFF 
file format. See [About Bio-Formats](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/bio-formats/about/index.html)
for further information.

Supported formats
-----------------

Bio-Formats supports [more than a hundred file
formats](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/bio-formats/supported-formats.html).


For users
---------

[Many software packages](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/bio-formats/users/index.html)
use Bio-Formats to read and write microscopy formats.


For developers
--------------

You can use Bio-Formats to easily [support these formats in your software](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/bio-formats/developers/java-library.html).
