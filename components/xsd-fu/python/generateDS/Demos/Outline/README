This directory contains a small example of the use of
generateDS.py.  It contains the following:

- outline.xsd -- The XML Schema file used to generate Python data
  representation classes.

- outline.py -- This file was generated by running:

    python generateDS.py -o outline.py outline.xsd

- outline_extended.py -- This file was produced by generating a
  subclass file, then adding methods that show the outline in a
  brief format.  It was initially generated by running:

    python generateDS.py -s outline_extended.py outline.xsd

  and then was edited to add the extensions.
  
- outline.xml -- A sample data file used the test the generated
  Python code.  Run either of the following:

    python outline.py outline.xml
    python outline_extended.py outline.xml
