This directory contains a simple example of the use of
generateDS.py.  The following files are provided:

- people.xsd -- This is the XML Schema file used to generate
  peoplesup.py and peoplesub.py

- peoplesup.py and peoplesub.py -- Generated from people.xsd.
  peoplesup.py contains the superclasses; peoplesub.py contains
  the generated subclasses. They were generated by running the
  following:

      $ python generateDS.py -o peoplesup.py -s peoplesub.py \
      --super=peoplesup --validator-bodies=Validators people.xsd

  Or, with a suitable modification to the path in run_test:

      $ ./run_test people people.xsd

  Notice that because the validator bodies sub-directory
  Validators contains a file named percent.py, you should see that
  the method validate_percent in class person in the generated
  file peoplesup.py as been filled in with a body.

- people.xml -- A data file used to test people.py.  Run the
  following:

    python peoplesup.py people.xml

  Or, edit the subclass file (peoplesub.py) and run that.  This
  modification is possibly not needed if you used the --super= flag.
