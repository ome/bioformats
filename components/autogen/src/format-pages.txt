notes = We strongly encourage users to export their .sld files to OME-TIFF \n
using the SlideBook software.  Bio-Formats is not likely to support the full \n
range of metadata that is included in .sld files, and so exporting to \n
OME-TIFF from SlideBook is the best way to ensure that all metadata is \n
preserved. \n
Free software from 3i can export the files to OME-TIFF post-acquisition, see \n
https://www.intelligent-imaging.com/slidebook.\n
\n
3i also develops a native SlideBook reader which works with Bio-Formats. See \n
http://www.openmicroscopy.org/info/slidebook for details.\n

library to read ND2 files compressed with JPEG-2000. \n
\n
There is also a **legacy** ND2 reader that uses Nikon's native libraries. \n
To use it, you must be using Windows 32-bit and have `Nikon's ND2 reader plugin for ImageJ \n
<http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/nd2-reader.html>`_ installed. \n
Additionally, you will need to download :source:`LegacyND2Reader.dll \n
<lib/LegacyND2Reader.dll?raw=true>` \n
and place it in your ImageJ plugin folder. \n
Note that this reader is **unmaintained** and no additional support effort \n
will be made. \n

ImageJ/FIJI will use the ZVI reader plugin in preference to Bio-Formats if \n
both are installed. If you have a problem which is solved by opening the file \n
using the Bio-Formats Importer plugin, you can just remove the \n
ZVI_Reader.class from the plugins folder. \n
