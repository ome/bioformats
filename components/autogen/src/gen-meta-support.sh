HEADER='# This file documents the metadata support for each file format that\n# Bio-Formats can handle. Default value for unlisted properties is Missing,\n# indicating that the property cannot be represented in the format, or our\n# knowledge regarding the property regarding this format is incomplete.\n\n# To define the status of a property, use the syntax:\n#\n#     Entity.Property = Status [Comment]\n#\n# "Status" is one of Yes, No, Partial or Missing.\n# There is usually no need to specify Missing status, as it is the default.\n#\n# "Comment" is optional extra text for specifying further details, such as\n# when the status changed. This value can include a revision, a ticket, a\n# datestamp or any other appropriate information.\n#\n# As a shortcut for every property of a given entity, you can write:\n#\n#     Entity [Comment]\n#\n# Examples:\n#\n#     Dimensions = Yes since r2351\n#     Objective.NominalMagnification = Yes added on 2008 Jan 8\n#     ImagingEnvironment.Temperature = Partial see ticket #167 for details\n'
