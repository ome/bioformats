This component provides backwards build compatibility for projects structured to use the old loci-common.jar. All code from loci-common has migrated to the scifio component, under new package names (ome.scifio.common, ome.scifio.enumeration, ome.scifio.io, ome.scifio.services and ome.scifio.xml). A new loci-legacy component provides delegator classes with the old package name (loci.common.*) for backwards compatibility. This loci-common component is merely a copy of loci-legacy.jar, and is intended for use with projects that cannot (or do not have time to) update their build systems to reference loci-legacy instead. Existing projects with control over their build systems should remove loci-common and add loci-legacy as a dependency, which will provide them with backwards compatibility to the old packages. New projects, and existing projects with control over their source code, do not need loci-common or loci-legacy at all, but rather should update their package names from the old (loci.common.*) to the new (ome.scifio.common.* et. al).
Note that for the time being, a scifio-devel component houses the new ome.scifio packages, while the scifio component holds unconverted loci.formats classes. Scifio-devel will eventually cease to exist after all loci.formats classes have been converted to SCIFIO equivalents, but until that time the loci-common jar must contain the union of loci-legacy + scifio-devel (that is, all legacy delegating classes + their current implementation). Because of this merging and the scope of scifio-devel, the loci-common.jar generated by this project will actually contain more classes than the legacy loci-common.jar did.. however the function and dependencies will remain unchanged. That is, loci-common.jar + scifio.jar will both be necessary and together will provide the same functionality.
