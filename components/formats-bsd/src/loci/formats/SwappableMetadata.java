 * Extends {@link CoreMetadata} to include the notion of an "input order" for planes:

 * NB: Input order can differ from the {@link CoreMetadata#dimensionOrder} field,
 * the latter being the order dimensions are returned (and thus returned by
 * {@link IFormatReader#getDimensionOrder()}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is primarily intended for use by {@link DimensionSwapper} and its children,
 * which introduce the API to separate input and output orders.
