/**
 * This class is an interface for any kind of compression or decompression.
 * Data is presented to the compressor in a 1D or 2D byte array,
 * with (optionally, depending on the compressor) pixel dimensions and
 * an Object containing any other options the compressor may need.
 *
 * If an argument is not appropriate for the compressor type, it is expected
 * to completely ignore the argument. i.e.: Passing a compressor that does not
 * require pixel dimensions null for the dimensions must not cause the
 * compressor to throw a NullPointerException.
 *
 * Classes implementing the Codec interface are expected to either
 * implement both compression methods or neither. (The same is expected for
 * decompression).
