            Bio-Formats File Format Reader Guide by Melissa Linkert

This document is a brief guide to writing new Bio-Formats file format readers.

All format readers should extend either loci.formats.FormatReader or a reader
in loci.formats.in.

                              Methods to Override
                             ---------------------

boolean isSingleFile(String id) throws FormatException, IOException:
  Whether or not the named file is expected to be the only file in the
  dataset.  This only needs to be overridden for formats whose datasets can
  contain more than one file.

boolean isThisType(RandomAccessInputStream) :
  Check the first few bytes of a file to determine if the file can be read by
  this reader.  You can assume that index 0 in the stream corresponds to
  the index 0 in the file.  Return true if the file can be read; false if
  not (or if there is no way of checking).

int fileGroupOption(String id) throws FormatException, IOException:
  Returns an indication of whether or not the files in a multi-file dataset
  can be handled individually.  The return value should be one of the
  following:

    * FormatTools.MUST_GROUP: the files cannot be handled separately
    * FormatTools.CAN_GROUP: the files may be handled separately or as a
                             single unit
    * FormatTools.CANNOT_GROUP: the files must be handled separately

  This method only needs to be overridden for formats whose datasets can
  contain more than one file.

String[] getSeriesUsedFiles(boolean noPixels) throws FormatException, IOException :
  You only need to override this if your format uses multiple files in a single
  dataset.  This method should return a list of all the files associated with
  the given file name and the current series (i.e. every file needed to display
  the current series).  If the 'noPixels' flag is set, then none of the files
  returned should contain pixel data.
  For an example of how this works, see loci.formats.in.PerkinElmerReader.
  It is recommended that the first line of this method be
  "FormatTools.assertId(currentId, true, 1)" - this ensures that the file name
  is non-null.

byte[] openBytes(int, byte[], int, int, int, int) throws FormatException, IOException :
  Returns a byte array containing the pixel data for a subimage specified
  image from the given file.  The dimensions of the subimage (upper left X
  coordinate, upper left Y coordinate, width, and height) are specified in the
  final four int parameters.  This should throw a FormatException if the image
  number is invalid (less than 0 or >= the number of images).  The ordering of
  the array returned by openBytes should correspond to the values returned by
  isLittleEndian() and isInterleaved().  Also, the length of the
  byte array should be [image width * image height * bytes per pixel].  Extra
  bytes will generally be truncated. It is recommended that the first line of
  this method be "FormatTools.checkPlaneParameters(this, no, buf.length, x, y,
  w, h)" - this ensures that all of the parameters are valid.

protected void initFile(String) throws FormatException, IOException :
  The majority of the file parsing logic should be placed in this method.  The
  idea is to call this method once (and only once!) when the file is first
  opened.  Generally, you will want to start by calling
  super.initFile(String).  You will also need to set up the stream for reading
  the file, as well as initializing any dimension information and metadata.
  Most of this logic is up to you; however, you should populate the 'core'
  variable (see loci.formats.CoreMetadata).

  Note that each variable is initialized to 0 or null when
  super.initFile(String) is called.
  Also, super.initFile(String) constructs a Hashtable called "metadata" where
  you should store any relevant metadata.

public void close(boolean fileOnly) throws IOException:
  Cleans up any resources used by the reader.  Global variables should be
  reset to their initial state, and any open files or delegate readers should
  be closed.

Note that if the new format is a variant of a format currently supported by
Bio-Formats, it is more efficient to make the new reader a subclass of the
existing reader (rather than subclassing FormatReader).  In this case, it is
usually sufficient to override initFile(String) and isThisType(byte[]).

Every reader also has an instance of loci.formats.CoreMetadata.  All readers
should populate the fields in CoreMetadata, which are essential to reading
image planes.

If you read from a file using something other than RandomAccessInputStream or
Location, you *must* use the file name returned by Location.getMappedId(String),
not the file name passed to the reader.
Thus, a stub for initFile(String) might look like this:

  protected void initFile(String id) throws FormatException, IOException {
    super.initFile(id);

    RandomAccessInputStream in = new RandomAccessInputStream(id);
    // alternatively,
    //FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream(Location.getMappedId(id));

    // read basic file structure and metadata from stream
  }

For more details, see the javadoc for Location.mapId(String, String)
and Location.getMappedId(String).

                             Variables to Populate
                            -----------------------

There are a number of global variables defined in loci.formats.FormatReader that
should be populated in the constructor of any implemented reader.

These variables are:

  * 'boolean suffixNecessary': indicates whether or not a file name suffix is
    required; true by default
  * 'boolean suffixSufficient': indicates whether or not a specific file name
    suffix guarantees that this reader can open a particular file; true by
    default
  * 'boolean hasCompanionFiles': indicates whether or not there is at least
    one file in a dataset of this format that contains only metadata (no
    images); false by default
  * 'String datasetDescription': a brief description of the layout of files
    in datasets of this format; only necessary for multi-file datasets


                              Other Useful Things
                             ---------------------

- loci.common.RandomAccessInputStream is a hybrid RandomAccessFile/InputStream
  class that is generally more efficient than either RandomAccessFile or
  InputStream, and implements the DataInput interface.  It is recommended that
  you use this for reading files.

- loci.formats.Location provides an API similar to java.io.File, and supports
  File-like operations on URLs.  It is highly recommended that you use this
  instead of File.  See the javadoc for additional information.

- loci.common.DataTools provides a number of methods for converting bytes to
  shorts, ints, longs, etc.  It also supports reading most primitive types
  directly from a RandomAccessInputStream (or other DataInput implementation).

- loci.formats.ImageTools provides several methods for manipulating
  primitive type arrays that represent images. Consult the source or javadoc
  for more information.

- If your reader relies on third-party code which may not be available to all
  users, it is strongly suggested that you make a corresponding service class
  that interfaces with the third-party code.  Please see:

  http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/wiki/BioFormats-Service

  for a description of the service infrastructure, as well as the
  loci.formats.services package.

- Several common image compression types are supported through subclasses of
  loci.formats.codec.BaseCodec.  These include JPEG, LZW, LZO, Base64, ZIP and
  RLE (PackBits).

- If you wish to convert a file's metadata to OME-XML (strongly encouraged),
  please see metadata-guide.txt further information.

- Utility methods for reading and writing individual bits from a byte array
  can be found in loci.formats.codec.BitBuffer and loci.formats.codec.BitWriter

- Once you have written your file format reader, add a line to the readers.txt
  file with the fully qualified name of the reader, followed by a '#' and the
  file extensions associated with the file format. Note that ImageReader,
  the master file format reader, tries to identify which format reader to use
  according to the order given in readers.txt, so be sure to place your reader
  in an appropriate position within the list.

- The easiest way to test your new reader is by calling "java
  loci.formats.tools.ImageInfo <file name>".  If all goes well, you should see
  all of the metadata and dimension information, along with a window showing
  the images in the file.  ImageReader can take additional parameters; a
  brief listing is provided for reference, but it is recommended that you
  take a look at the contents of loci.formats.tools.ImageInfo to see exactly
  what each one does.

    Argument            Action
    --------------------------
    -version: print the library version and exit
        file: the image file to read
      -nopix: read metadata only, not pixels
     -nocore: do not output core metadata
     -nometa: do not parse format-specific metadata table
   -nofilter: do not filter metadata fields
     -thumbs: read thumbnails instead of normal pixels
     -minmax: compute min/max statistics
      -merge: combine separate channels into RGB image
    -nogroup: force multi-file datasets to be read as individual files
     -stitch: stitch files with similar names
   -separate: split RGB image into separate channels
     -expand: expand indexed color to RGB
     -omexml: populate OME-XML metadata
  -normalize: normalize floating point images*
       -fast: paint RGB images as quickly as possible*
      -debug: turn on debugging output
      -range: specify range of planes to read (inclusive)
     -series: specify which image series to read
       -swap: override the default input dimension order
    -shuffle: override the default output dimension order
        -map: specify file on disk to which name should be mapped
    -preload: pre-read entire file into a buffer; significantly
              reduces the time required to read the images, but
              requires more memory
       -crop: crop images before displaying; argument is 'x,y,w,h'
  -autoscale: used in combination with '-fast' to automatically adjust
              brightness and contrast
    -novalid: do not perform validation of OME-XML
-omexml-only: only output the generated OME-XML
     -format: read file with a particular reader (e.g., ZeissZVI)

- If you wish to test using TestNG, loci.tests.testng.FormatReaderTest provides
  several basic tests that work with all Bio-Formats readers.  See the
  FormatReaderTest source code for additional information.

- For more details, please look at the source code and javadocs.  Studying
  existing readers is probably the best way to get a feel for the API; I would
  recommend first looking at loci.formats.in.ImarisReader (this is the most
  straightforward one).  loci.formats.in.LIFReader and InCellReader are also
  good references that show off some of the nicer features of Bio-Formats.
