SCIFIO-devel is a necessary intermediate component as legacy classes are converted to SCIFIO components and package structures. As classes are converted from the SCIFIO component (or from loci-common, or other legacy components) they are placed in SCIFIO-devel, removed from their original component, and a delegator with the original package and class name is placed in the loci-legacy component, to preserve the API for backwards-compatibility while passing functional control to SCIFIO-devel. Thus loci-legacy + SCIFIO-devel are used in tandem to preserve backwards compatibility, but for an application that controls its own source the delegation layer can be bypassed by coding directly against SCIFIO-devel. When the SCIFIO component is completely converted and empty, SCIFIO-devel will be eliminated and become the SCIFIO component - so that transition should be considered when adding SCIFIO-devel as a dependency.
