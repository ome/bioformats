/**
 * This class defines a Buffered Random Access File.  It implements the
 * <tt>BinaryDataInput</tt> and <tt>BinaryDataOutput</tt> interfaces so that
 * binary data input/output can be performed. This class is abstract since no
 * assumption is done about the byte ordering type (little Endian, big
 * Endian). So subclasses will have to implement methods like
 * <tt>readShort()</tt>, <tt>writeShort()</tt>, <tt>readFloat()</tt>, ...
 *
 * <P><tt>BufferedRandomAccessFile</tt> (BRAF for short) is a
 * <tt>RandomAccessFile</tt> containing an extra buffer. When the BRAF is
 * accessed, it checks if the requested part of the file is in the buffer or
 * not. If that is the case, the read/write is done on the buffer. If not, the
 * file is uppdated to reflect the current status of the buffer and the file
 * is then accessed for a new buffer containing the requested byte/bit.
