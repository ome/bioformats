/**
 * This is the abstract class from which all dequantizers must inherit. This
 * class has the concept of a current tile and all operations are performed on
 * the current tile.
 *
 * <p>This class provides default implemenations for most of the methods
 * (wherever it makes sense), under the assumption that the image and
 * component dimensions, and the tiles, are not modifed by the dequantizer. If
 * that is not the case for a particular implementation then the methods
 * should be overriden.</p>
 *
 * <p>Sign magnitude representation is used (instead of two's complement) for
 * the input data. The most significant bit is used for the sign (0 if
 * positive, 1 if negative). Then the magnitude of the quantized coefficient
 * is stored in the next most significat bits. The most significant magnitude
 * bit corresponds to the most significant bit-plane and so on.</p>
 *
 * <p>The output data is either in floating-point, or in fixed-point two's
 * complement. In case of floating-point data the the value returned by
 * getFixedPoint() must be 0. If the case of fixed-point data the number of
 * fractional bits must be defined at the constructor of the implementing
 * class and all operations must be performed accordingly. Each component may
 * have a different number of fractional bits.</p>
