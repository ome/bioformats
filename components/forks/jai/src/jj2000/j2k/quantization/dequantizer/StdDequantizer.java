/**
 * This class implements a scalar dequantizer with deadzone. The output can be
 * either integer ('int') or floating-point ('float') data. The dequantization
 * step sizes and other parameters are taken from a StdDequantizerParams
 * class, which inherits from DequantizerParams.
 *
 * <P>Sign magnitude representation is used (instead of two's complement) for
 * the input data. The most significant bit is used for the sign (0 if
 * positive, 1 if negative). Then the magnitude of the quantized coefficient
 * is stored in the next most significat bits. The most significant magnitude
 * bit corresponds to the most significant bit-plane and so on.
 *
 * <P>When reversible quantization is used, this class only converts between
 * the sign-magnitude representation and the integer (or eventually
 * fixed-point) output, since there is no true quantization.
 *
 * <P>The output data is fixed-point two's complement for 'int' output and
 * floating-point for 'float' output. The type of output and the number number
 * of fractional bits for 'int' output are defined at the constructor. Each
 * component may have a different number of fractional bits.
 *
 * <P>The reconstruction levels used by the dequantizer are exactly what is
 * received from the entropy decoder. It is assumed that the entropy decoder
 * always returns codewords that are midways in the decoded intervals. In this
 * way the dequantized values will always lie midways in the quantization
 * intervals.
