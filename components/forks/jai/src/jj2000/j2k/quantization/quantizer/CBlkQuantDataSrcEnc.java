/**
 * This interface defines a source of quantized wavelet coefficients and
 * methods to transfer them in a code-block by code-block basis. In each call
 * to 'getNextCodeBlock()' or 'getNextInternCodeBlock()' a new code-block is
 * returned. The code-blocks are returned in no specific order.
 *
 * <p>This class is the source of data for the entropy coder. See the
 * 'EntropyCoder' class.</p>
 *
 * <p>Code-block data is returned in sign-magnitude representation, instead of
 * the normal two's complement one. Only integral types are used. The sign
 * magnitude representation is more adequate for entropy coding. In sign
 * magnitude representation, the most significant bit is used for the sign (0
 * if positive, 1 if negative) and the magnitude of the coefficient is stored
 * in the next M most significant bits. The rest of the bits (least
 * significant bits) can contain a fractional value of the quantized
 * coefficient. The number 'M' of magnitude bits is communicated in the
 * 'magbits' member variable of the 'CBlkWTData'.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that no more of one object may request data, otherwise one object
 * would get some of the data and another one another part, in no defined
 * manner.</p>
