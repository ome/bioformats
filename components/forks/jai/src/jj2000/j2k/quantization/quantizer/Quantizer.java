/**
 * This abstract class provides the general interface for quantizers. The
 * input of a quantizer is the output of a wavelet transform. The output of
 * the quantizer is the set of quantized wavelet coefficients represented in
 * sign-magnitude notation (see below).
 *
 * <p>This class provides default implementation for most of the methods
 * (wherever it makes sense), under the assumption that the image, component
 * dimensions, and the tiles, are not modifed by the quantizer. If it is not
 * the case for a particular implementation, then the methods should be
 * overriden.</p>
 *
 * <p>Sign magnitude representation is used (instead of two's complement) for
 * the output data. The most significant bit is used for the sign (0 if
 * positive, 1 if negative). Then the magnitude of the quantized coefficient
 * is stored in the next M most significat bits. The rest of the bits (least
 * significant bits) can contain a fractional value of the quantized
 * coefficient. This fractional value is not to be coded by the entropy
 * coder. However, it can be used to compute rate-distortion measures with
 * greater precision.</p>
 *
 * <p>The value of M is determined for each subband as the sum of the number
 * of guard bits G and the nominal range of quantized wavelet coefficients in
 * the corresponding subband (Rq), minus 1:</p>
 *
 * <p>M = G + Rq -1</p>
 *
 * <p>The value of G should be the same for all subbands. The value of Rq
 * depends on the quantization step size, the nominal range of the component
 * before the wavelet transform and the analysis gain of the subband (see
 * Subband).</p>
 *
 * <p>The blocks of data that are requested should not cross subband
 * boundaries.</p>
 *
 * <p>NOTE: At the moment only quantizers that implement the
 * 'CBlkQuantDataSrcEnc' interface are supported.</p>
 *
 * @see Subband
