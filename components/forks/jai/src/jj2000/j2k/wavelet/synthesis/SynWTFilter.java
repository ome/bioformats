/**
 * This abstract class defines the methods of all synthesis wavelet
 * filters. Specialized abstract classes that work on particular data
 * types (int, float) provide more specific method calls while
 * retaining the generality of this one. See the SynWTFilterInt
 * and SynWTFilterFloat classes. Implementations of snythesis
 * filters should inherit from one of those classes.
 *
 * <P>The length of the output signal is always the sum of the length
 * of the low-pass and high-pass input signals.
 *
 * <P>All synthesis wavelet filters should follow the following conventions:
 *
 * <P>- The first sample of the output corresponds to the low-pass
 * one. As a consequence, if the output signal is of odd-length then
 * the low-pass input signal is one sample longer than the high-pass
 * input one. Therefore, if the length of output signal is N, the
 * low-pass input signal is of length N/2 if N is even and N/2+1/2 if
 * N is odd, while the high-pass input signal is of length N/2 if N
 * is even and N/2-1/2 if N is odd.
 *
 * <P>- The normalization of the analysis filters is 1 for the DC gain
 * and 2 for the Nyquist gain (Type I normalization), for both
 * reversible and non-reversible filters. The normalization of the
 * synthesis filters should ensure prefect reconstruction according to
 * this normalization of the analysis wavelet filters.
 *
 * <P>The synthetize method may seem very complicated, but is designed to
 * minimize the amount of data copying and redundant calculations when
 * used for block-based or line-based wavelet transform
 * implementations, while being applicable to full-frame transforms as
 * well.

     * Reconstructs the output signal by the synthesis filter,
     * recomposing the low-pass and high-pass input signals in one
     * output signal. This method performs the upsampling and
     * fitering with the low pass first filtering convention.
     *
     * <P>The input low-pass (high-pass) signal resides in the lowSig
     * array. The index of the first sample to filter (i.e. that will
     * generate the first (second) output sample). is given by lowOff
     * (highOff). This array must be of the same type as the one for
     * which the particular implementation works with (which is
     * returned by the getDataType() method).
     *
     * <P>The low-pass (high-pass) input signal can be interleaved
     * with other signals in the same lowSig (highSig) array, and this
     * is determined by the lowStep (highStep) argument. This means
     * that the first sample of the low-pass (high-pass) input signal
     * is lowSig[lowOff] (highSig[highOff]), the second is
     * lowSig[lowOff+lowStep] (highSig[highOff+highStep]), the third
     * is lowSig[lowOff+2*lowStep] (highSig[highOff+2*highStep]), and
     * so on. Therefore if lowStep (highStep) is 1 there is no
     * interleaving. This feature allows to filter columns of a 2-D
     * signal, when it is stored in a line by line order in lowSig
     * (highSig), without having to copy the data, in this case the
     * lowStep (highStep) argument should be the line width of the
     * low-pass (high-pass) signal.
     *
     * <P>The output signal is placed in the outSig array. The outOff
     * and outStep arguments are analogous to the lowOff and lowStep
     * ones, but they apply to the outSig array. The outSig array must
     * be long enough to hold the low-pass output signal.
     *
     * @param lowSig This is the array that contains the low-pass
     * input signal. It must be of the correct type (e.g., it must be
     * int[] if getDataType() returns TYPE_INT).
     *
     * @param lowOff This is the index in lowSig of the first sample to
     * filter.
     *
     * @param lowLen This is the number of samples in the low-pass
     * input signal to filter.
     *
     * @param lowStep This is the step, or interleave factor, of the
     * low-pass input signal samples in the lowSig array. See above.
     *
     * @param highSig This is the array that contains the high-pass
     * input signal. It must be of the correct type (e.g., it must be
     * int[] if getDataType() returns TYPE_INT).
