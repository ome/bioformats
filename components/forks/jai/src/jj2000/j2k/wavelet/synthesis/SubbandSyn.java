 * This class represents a subband in a tree structure that describes

 * the syhthesis side.
 *
 * <P>The element can be either a node or a leaf of the tree. If it is
 * a node then ther are 4 descendants (LL, HL, LH and HH). If it is a
 * leaf there are no descendants.
 *
 * <P>The tree is bidirectional. Each element in the tree structure
 * has a "parent", which is the subband from which the element was
 * obtained by decomposition. The only exception is the root element
 * which has no parent (i.e.it's null), for obvious reasons.
