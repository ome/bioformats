 * This abstract class extends the WaveletTransform one with the specifics of

 *
 * <P>The image can be reconstructed at different resolution levels. This is
 * controlled by the setResLevel() method. All the image, tile and component
 * dimensions are relative the the resolution level being used. The number of
 * resolution levels indicates the number of wavelet recompositions that will
 * be used, if it is equal as the number of decomposition levels then the full
 * resolution image is reconstructed.
 *
 * <P>It is assumed in this class that all tiles and components the same
 * reconstruction resolution level. If that where not the case the
 * implementing class should have additional data structures to store those
 * values for each tile. However, the 'recResLvl' member variable always
 * contain the values applicable to the current tile, since many methods
