/**
 * This interface defines methods to access image attributes (width, height,
 * number of components, etc.) of multiresolution images, such as those
 * resulting from an inverse wavelet transform. The image can be tiled or not
 * (i.e. if the image is not tiled then there is only 1 tile). It should be
 * implemented by all classes that provide multi-resolution image data, such
 * as entropy decoders, dequantizers, etc. This interface, however, does not
 * define methods to transfer image data (i.e. pixel data), that is defined by
 * other interfaces, such as 'CBlkQuantDataSrcDec'.
 *
 * <p>This interface is very similar to the 'ImgData' one. It differs only by
 * the fact that it handles multiple resolutions.</p>
 *
 * <p>Resolution levels are counted from 0 to L. Resolution level 0 is the
 * lower resolution, while L is the maximum resolution level, or full
 * resolution, which is returned by 'getMaxResLvl()'. Note that there are L+1
 * resolution levels available.</p>
 *
 * <p>As in the 'ImgData' interface a multi-resolution image lies on top of a
 * canvas. The canvas coordinates are mapped from the full resolution
 * reference grid (i.e. resolution level 'L' reference grid) to a resolution
 * level 'l' reference grid by '(x_l,y_l) =
 * (ceil(x_l/2^(L-l)),ceil(y_l/2^(L-l)))', where '(x,y)' are the full
 * resolution reference grid coordinates and '(x_l,y_l)' are the level 'l'
 * reference grid coordinates.</p>
 *
 * <p>For details on the canvas system and its implications consult the
 * 'ImgData' interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that tile sizes may not be obtained by simply dividing the tile
 * size in the reference grid by the subsampling factor.</p>
