     * 0 having 2 decomposition levels and component 1 having 3
     * decomposition levels), the first (tile-) component has 3
     * resolution levels and the second one has 4 resolution levels,
     * whereas the image has only 3 resolution levels available.

     * system, on the reference grid.
