 * This abstract class represents a subband in a bidirectional tree structure
 * that describes the subband decomposition for a wavelet transform. This
 * class is implemented by the SubbandAn and SubbandSyn classes, which are for
 * the analysis and synthesis sides, respectively.
 *
 * <P>The element can be either a node or a leaf of the tree. If it is a node
 * then ther are 4 descendants (LL, HL, LH and HH). If it is a leaf ther are
 * no descendants.
 *
 * <P>The tree is bidirectional. Each element in the tree structure has a
 * "parent", which is the subband from which the element was obtained by
 * decomposition. The only exception is the root element which has no parent
 * (i.e.it's null), for obvious reasons.
