/**
 * This is a generic abstract class to store a code-block of wavelet data, be
 * it quantized or not. This class does not have the notion of
 * components. Therefore, it should be used for data from a single
 * component. Subclasses should implement the different types of storage
 * (<tt>int</tt>, <tt>float</tt>, etc.).
 *
 * <P>The data is always stored in one array, of the type matching the data
 * type (i.e. for 'int' it's an 'int[]'). The data should be stored in the
 * array in standard scan-line order. That is the samples go from the top-left
 * corner of the code-block to the lower-right corner by line and then column.
 *
 * <P>The member variable 'offset' gives the index in the array of the first
 * data element (i.e. the top-left coefficient). The member variable 'scanw'
 * gives the width of the scan that is used to store the data, that can be
 * different from the width of the block. Element '(x,y)' of the code-block
 * (i.e. '(0,0)' is the top-left coefficient), will appear at position
 * 'offset+y*scanw+x' in the array of data.
 *
 * <P>The classes <tt>CBlkWTDataInt</tt> and <tt>CBlkWTDataFloat</tt>
 * provide implementations for <tt>int</tt> and <tt>float</tt> types
 * respectively.
 *
 * <P>The types of data are the same as those defined by the 'DataBlk' class.
