/**
 * This abstract class defines the methods of all analysis wavelet
 * filters. Specialized abstract classes that work on particular data
 * types (int, float) provide more specific method calls while
 * retaining the generality of this one. See the AnWTFilterInt
 * and AnWTFilterFloat classes. Implementations of analysis
 * filters should inherit from one of those classes.
 *
 * <P>All analysis wavelet filters should follow the following conventions:
 *
 * <P>- The first sample to filter is the low-pass one. As a
 * consequence, if the input signal is of odd-length then the low-pass
 * output signal is one sample longer than the high-pass output
 * one. Therefore, if the length of input signal is N, the low-pass
 * output signal is of length N/2 if N is even and N/2+1/2 if N is
 * odd, while the high-pass output signal is of length N/2 if N is
 * even and N/2-1/2 if N is odd.
 *
 * <P>- The normalization is 1 for the DC gain and 2 for the Nyquist
 * gain (Type I normalization), for both reversible and non-reversible
 * filters.
 *
 * <P>If the length of input signal is N, the low-pass output signal
 * is of length N/2 if N is even and N/2+1/2 if N is odd, while the
 * high-pass output sample is of length N/2 if N is even and N/2-1/2
 * if N is odd.
 *
 * <P>The analyze method may seem very complicated, but is designed to
 * minimize the amount of data copying and redundant calculations when
 * used for block-based or line-based wavelet transform
 * implementations, while being applicable to full-frame transforms as
 * well.
 *
 * <P>All filters should implement the equals() method of the Object
 * class. The call x.equals(y) should test if the 'x' and 'y' filters are the
 * same or not, in what concerns the bit stream header syntax (two filters are
 * the same if the same filter code should be output to the bit stream).
 *
 * @see AnWTFilterInt
 *
 * @see AnWTFilterFloat

     * Filters the input signal by this analysis filter, decomposing
     * it in a low-pass and a high-pass signal. This method performs
     * the filtering and the subsampling with the low pass first
     * filtering convention.
     *
     * <P>The input signal resides in the inSig array. The index of
     * the first sample to filter (i.e. that will generate the first
     * low-pass output sample) is given by inOff. The number of
     * samples to filter is given by inLen. This array must be of the
     * same type as the one for which the particular implementation
     * works with (which is returned by the getDataType() method).
     *
     * <P>The input signal can be interleaved with other signals in
     * the same inSig array, and this is determined by the inStep
     * argument. This means that the first sample of the input signal
     * is inSig[inOff], the second is inSig[inOff+inStep], the third
     * is inSig[inOff+2*inStep], and so on. Therefore if inStep is 1
     * there is no interleaving. This feature allows to filter columns
     * of a 2-D signal, when it is stored in a line by line order in
     * inSig, without having to copy the data, in this case the inStep
     * argument should be the line width.
     *
     * <P>This method also allows to apply the analysis wavelet filter
     * by parts in the input signal using an overlap and thus
     * producing the same coefficients at the output. The tailOvrlp
     * argument specifies how many samples in the input signal, before
     * the first one to be filtered, can be used for overlap. Then,
     * the filter instead of extending the input signal will use those
     * samples to calculate the first output samples. The argument
     * tailOvrlp can be 0 for no overlap, or some value that provides
     * partial or full overlap. There should be enough samples in the
     * input signal, before the first sample to be filtered, to
     * support the overlap. The headOvrlp provides the same
     * functionality but at the end of the input signal. The inStep
     * argument also applies to samples used for overlap. This overlap
     * feature can be used for line-based wavelet transforms (in which
     * case it will only be used when filtering the columns) or for
     * overlapping block-based wavelet transforms (in which case it
     * will be used when filtering lines and columns).
     *
     * <P>The low-pass output signal is placed in the lowSig
     * array. The lowOff and lowStep arguments are analogous to the
     * inOff and inStep ones, but they apply to the lowSig array. The
     * lowSig array must be long enough to hold the low-pass output
     * signal.
     *
     * <P>The high-pass output signal is placed in the highSig
     * array. The highOff and highStep arguments are analogous to the
     * inOff and inStep ones, but they apply to the highSig array. The
     * highSig array must be long enough to hold the high-pass output
     * signal.
