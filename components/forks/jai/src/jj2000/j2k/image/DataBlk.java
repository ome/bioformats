/**
 * This is a generic abstract class to store data from a block of an
 * image. This class does not have the notion of components. Therefore, it
 * should be used for data from a single component. Subclasses should
 * implement the different types of storage (<tt>int</tt>,
 * <tt>float</tt>, etc.).
 *
 * <P>The data is always stored in one array, of the type matching the data
 * type (i.e. for 'int' it's an 'int[]'). The data should be stored in the
 * array in standard scan-line order. That is the samples go from the top-left
 * corner of the code-block to the lower-right corner by line and then column.
 *
 * <P>The member variable 'offset' gives the index in the array of the first
 * data element (i.e. the top-left coefficient (ulx,uly)). The member variable
 * 'scanw' gives the width of the scan that is used to store the data, that
 * can be different from the width of the block. Element '(x,y)' of the
 * code-block (i.e. '(ulx,uly)' is the top-left coefficient), will appear at
 * position 'offset+(y-uly)*scanw+(x-ulx)' in the array of data.
 *
 * <P>A block of data can have the <i>progressive</i> attribute
 * set. Data is progressive when it is obtained by successive
 * refinement and the values in this block are approximations of the
 * "final" values. When the final values are returned the progressive
 * attribute must be turned off.
 *
 * <P>The classes <tt>DataBlkInt</tt> and <tt>DataBlkFloat</tt>
 * provide implementations for <tt>int</tt> and <tt>float</tt> types
 * respectively.

 * @see DataBlkInt
