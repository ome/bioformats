 * This class implements the ImgData interface and allows to obtain data from
 * different sources. Here, one source is represented by an ImgData and a
 * component index. The typical use of this class is when the encoder needs
 * different components (Red, Green, Blue, alpha, ...) from different input
 * files (i.e. from different ImgReader objects).
 *
 * <p>All input ImgData must not be tiled (i.e. must have only 1 tile) and the
 * image origin must be the canvas origin. The different inputs can have
 * different dimensions though (this will lead to different subsampling
 * factors for each component).</p>
 *
 * <p>The input ImgData and component index list must be defined when
 * constructing this class and can not be modified later.</p>
