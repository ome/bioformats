/**
 * This class places an image in the canvas coordinate system, tiles it, if so
 * specified, and performs the coordinate conversions transparently. The
 * source must be a 'BlkImgDataSrc' which is not tiled and has a the image
 * origin at the canvas origin (i.e. it is not "canvased"), or an exception is
 * thrown by the constructor. A tiled and "canvased" output is given through
 * the 'BlkImgDataSrc' interface. See the 'ImgData' interface for a
 * description of the canvas and tiling.
 *
 * <p>All tiles produced are rectangular, non-overlapping and their union
 * covers all the image. However, the tiling may not be uniform, depending on
 * the nominal tile size, tiling origin, component subsampling and other
 * factors. Therefore it might not be assumed that all tiles are of the same
 * width and height.</p>
 *
 * <p>The nominal dimension of the tiles is the maximal one, in the reference
 * grid. All the components of the image have the same number of tiles.</p>
