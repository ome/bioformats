/**
 * This class stores the specification of a layer distribution in the
 * bit stream. The specification is made of optimization points and a number of
 * extra layers to add between the optimization points. Each optimization
 * point creates a layer which is optimized by the rate allocator to the
 * specified target bitrate. The extra layers are added by the rate allocator
 * between the optimized layers, with the difference that they are not
 * optimized (i.e. they have no precise target bitrate).
 *
 * <P>The overall target bitrate for the bit stream is always added as the last
 * optimization point without any extra layers after it. If there are some
 * optimization points whose target bitrate is larger than the overall target
 * bitrate, the overall target bitrate will still appear as the last
 * optimization point, even though it does not follow the increasing target
 * bitrate order of the other optimization points. The rate allocator is
 * responsible for eliminating layers that have target bitrates larger than
 * the overall target bitrate.
 *
 * <P>Optimization points can be added with the addOptPoint() method. It takes
 * the target bitrate for the optimized layer and the number of extra layers
 * to add after it.
 *
 * <P>Information about the total number of layers, total number of
 * optimization points, target bitrates, etc. can be obtained with the other
 * methods.
