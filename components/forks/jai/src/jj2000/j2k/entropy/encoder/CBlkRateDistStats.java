/**
 * This class stores coded (compressed) code-blocks with their associated
 * rate-distortion statistics. This object should always contain all the
 * compressed data of the code-block. It is applicable to the encoder engine
 * only. Some data of the coded-block is stored in the super class, see
 * CodedCBlk.
 *
 * <P>The rate-distortion statistics (i.e. R-D slope) is stored for valid
 * points only. The set of valid points is determined by the entropy coder
 * engine itself. Normally they are selected so as to lye in a convex hull,
 * which can be achived by using the 'selectConvexHull' method of this class,
 * but some other strategies might be employed.
 *
 * <P>The rate (in bytes) for each truncation point (valid or not) is stored
 * in the 'truncRates' array. The rate of a truncation point is the total
 * number of bytes in 'data' (see super class) that have to be decoded to
 * reach the truncation point.
 *
 * <P>The slope (reduction of distortion divided by the increase in rate) at
 * each of the valid truncation points is stored in 'truncSlopes'.
 *
 * <P>The index of each valid truncation point is stored in 'truncIdxs'. The
 * index should be interpreted in the following way: a valid truncation point
 * at position 'n' has the index 'truncIdxs[n]', the rate
 * 'truncRates[truncIdxs[n]]' and the slope 'truncSlopes[n]'. The arrays
 * 'truncIdxs' and 'truncRates' have at least 'nVldTrunc' elements. The
 * 'truncRates' array has at least 'nTotTrunc' elements.
 *
 * <P>In addition the 'isTermPass' array contains a flag for each truncation
 * point (valid and non-valid ones) that tells if the pass is terminated or
 * not. If this variable is null then it means that no pass is terminated,
 * except the last one which always is.
 *
 * <P>The compressed data is stored in the 'data' member variable of the super
 * class.
