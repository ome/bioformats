/**
 * This class implements the MQ arithmetic coder. When initialized a specific
 * state can be specified for each context, which may be adapted to the
 * probability distribution that is expected for that context.
 *
 * <P>The type of length calculation and termination can be chosen at
 * construction time.
 *
 * ---- Tricks that have been tried to improve speed ----
 *
 * 1) Merging Qe and mPS and doubling the lookup tables
 *
 * Merge the mPS into Qe, as the sign bit (if Qe>=0 the sense of MPS is 0, if
 * Qe<0 the sense is 1), and double the lookup tables. The first half of the
 * lookup tables correspond to Qe>=0 (i.e. the sense of MPS is 0) and the
 * second half to Qe<0 (i.e. the sense of MPS is 1). The nLPS lookup table is
 * modified to incorporate the changes in the sense of MPS, by making it jump
 * from the first to the second half and vice-versa, when a change is
 * specified by the swicthLM lookup table. See JPEG book, section 13.2, page
 * 225.
 *
 * There is NO speed improvement in doing this, actually there is a slight
 * decrease, probably due to the fact that often Q has to be negated. Also the
 * fact that a brach of the type "if (bit==mPS[li])" is replaced by two
 * simpler braches of the type "if (bit==0)" and "if (q<0)" may contribute to
 * that.
 *
 * 2) Removing cT
 *
 * It is possible to remove the cT counter by setting a flag bit in the high
 * bits of the C register. This bit will be automatically shifted left
 * whenever a renormalization shift occurs, which is equivalent to decreasing
 * cT. When the flag bit reaches the sign bit (leftmost bit), which is
 * equivalenet to cT==0, the byteOut() procedure is called. This test can be
 * done efficiently with "c<0" since C is a signed quantity. Care must be
 * taken in byteOut() to reset the bit in order to not interfere with other
 * bits in the C register. See JPEG book, page 228.
 *
 * There is NO speed improvement in doing this. I don't really know why since
 * the number of operations whenever a renormalization occurs is
 * decreased. Maybe it is due to the number of extra operations in the
 * byteOut(), terminate() and getNumCodedBytes() procedures.
 *
 * 3) Change the convention of MPS and LPS.
 *
 * Making the LPS interval be above the MPS interval (MQ coder convention is
 * the opposite) can reduce the number of operations along the MPS path. In
 * order to generate the same bit stream as with the MQ convention the output
 * bytes need to be modified accordingly. The basic rule for this is that C =
 * (C'^0xFF...FF)-A, where C is the codestream for the MQ convention and C' is
 * the codestream generated by this other convention. Note that this affects
 * bit-stuffing as well.
 *
 * This has not been tested yet.
 *
 * 4) Removing normalization while loop on MPS path
 *
 * Since in the MPS path Q is guaranteed to be always greater than 0x4000
 * (decimal 0.375) it is never necessary to do more than 1 renormalization
 * shift. Therefore the test of the while loop, and the loop itself, can be
 * removed.
 *
 * 5) Simplifying test on A register
 *
 * Since A is always less than or equal to 0xFFFF, the test "(a & 0x8000)==0"
 * can be replaced by the simplete test "a < 0x8000". This test is simpler in
 * Java since it involves only 1 operation (although the original test can be
 * converted to only one operation by  smart Just-In-Time compilers)
 *
 * This change has been integrated in the decoding procedures.
 *
 * 6) Speedup mode
 *
 * Implemented a method that uses the speedup mode of the MQ-coder if
 * possible. This should greately improve performance when coding long runs of
 * MPS symbols that have high probability. However, to take advantage of this,
 * the entropy coder implementation has to explicetely use it. The generated
 * bit stream is the same as if no speedup mode would have been used.
 *
 * Implemented but performance not tested yet.
 *
 * 7) Multiple-symbol coding
 *
 * Since the time spent in a method call is non-negligable, coding several
 * symbols with one method call reduces the overhead per coded symbol. The
 * decodeSymbols() method implements this. However, to take advantage of it,
 * the implementation of the entropy coder has to explicitely use it.
 *
 * Implemented but performance not tested yet.
