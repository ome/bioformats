     * Returns the specified coded code-block, for the specified component, in

     * number of layers that is returned depends on 'nl' and the amount of
     * data available.
     *
     * <P>The argument 'fl' is to be used by subsequent calls to this method
     * for the same code-block. In this way supplamental data can be retrieved
     * at a later time. The fact that data from more than one layer can be
     * returned means that several packets from the same code-block, of the
     * same component, and the same tile, have been concatenated.
     *
     * <P>The returned compressed code-block can have its progressive
     * attribute set. If this attribute is set it means that more data can be
     * obtained by subsequent calls to this method (subject to transmission
     * delays, etc). If the progressive attribute is not set it means that the
     * returned data is all the data that can be obtained for the specified
     * subblock.
     *
     * <P>The compressed code-block is uniquely specified by the current tile,
     * the component (identified by 'c'), the subband (indentified by 'sb')
     * and the code-bock vertical and horizontal indexes 'm' and 'n'.
     *
     * <P>The 'ulx' and 'uly' members of the returned 'DecLyrdCBlk' object
     * contain the coordinates of the top-left corner of the block, with
     * respect to the tile, not the subband.
     *
     * @param c The index of the component, from 0 to N-1.
     *
     * @param m The vertical index of the code-block to return, in the
     * specified subband.
     *
     * @param n The horizontal index of the code-block to return, in the
     * specified subband.
     *
     * @param sb The subband in whic the requested code-block is.
     *
     * @param fl The first layer to return.
     *
     * @param nl The number of layers to return, if negative all available
     * layers are returned, starting at 'fl'.
     *
     * @param ccb If not null this object is used to return the compressed
     * code-block. If null a new object is created and returned. If the data
     * array in ccb is not null then it can be reused to return the compressed
     * data.
