/**
 * This class implements the JPEG 2000 entropy decoder, which codes stripes in
 * code-blocks. This entropy decoding engine decodes one code-block at a time.
 *
 * The code-block are rectangular, with dimensions which must be powers of
 * 2. Each dimension has to be no smaller than 4 and no larger than 256. The
 * product of the two dimensions (i.e. area of the code-block) may not exceed
 * 4096.
 *
 * Context 0 of the MQ-coder is used as the uniform one (uniform, non-adaptive
 * probability distribution). Context 1 is used for RLC coding. Contexts 2-10
 * are used for zero-coding (ZC), contexts 11-15 are used for sign-coding (SC)
 * and contexts 16-18 are used for magnitude-refinement (MR).
 *
 * <P>This implementation also provides some timing features. They can be
 * enabled by setting the 'DO_TIMING' constant of this class to true and
 * recompiling. The timing uses the 'System.currentTimeMillis()' Java API
 * call, which returns wall clock time, not the actual CPU time used. The
 * timing results will be printed on the message output. Since the times
 * reported are wall clock times and not CPU usage times they can not be added
 * to find the total used time (i.e. some time might be counted in several
 * places). When timing is disabled ('DO_TIMING' is false) there is no penalty
 * if the compiler performs some basic optimizations. Even if not the penalty
 * should be negligeable.
