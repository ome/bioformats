 * tile.

 * through the 'MultiResImgDataAdapter' abstract class.
 *
 * <P>Sign magnitude representation is used (instead of two's complement) for
 * the output data. The most significant bit is used for the sign (0 if
 * positive, 1 if negative). Then the magnitude of the quantized coefficient
 * is stored in the next most significat bits. The most significant magnitude
 * bit corresponds to the most significant bit-plane and so on.
