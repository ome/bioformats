/**
 * This class provides a simple common abstraction of a facility that logs
 * and/or displays messages or simple strings. The underlying facility can be
 * a terminal, text file, text area in a GUI display, dialog boxes in a GUI
 * display, etc., or a combination of those.
 *
 * <P>Messages are short strings (a couple of lines) that indicate some state
 * of the program, and that have a severity code associated with them (see
 * below). Simple strings is text (can be long) that has no severity code
 * associated with it. Typical use of simple strings is to display help texts.
 *
 * <P>Each message has a severity code, which can be one of the following:
 * LOG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR. Each implementation should treat each severity
 * code in a way which corresponds to the type of diplay used.
 *
 * <P>Messages are printed via the 'printmsg()' method. Simple strings are
 * printed via the 'print()', 'println()' and 'flush()' methods, each simple
 * string is considered to be terminated once the 'flush()' method has been
 * called. The 'printmsg()' method should never be called before a previous
 * simple string has been terminated.
