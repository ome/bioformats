/**
 * This class implements a thread pool. The thread pool contains a set of
 * threads which can be given work to do.
 *
 * <P>If the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) uses native threads, then the
 * different threads will be able to execute in different processors in
 * parallel on multiprocessors machines. However, under some JVMs and
 * operating systems using native threads is not sufficient to allow the JVM
 * access to multiple processors. This is the case when native threads are
 * implemented using POSIX threads on lightweight processes
 * (i.e. PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS sopce scheduling), which is the case on most
 * UNIX operating systems. In order to do provide access to multiple
 * processors it is necessary to set the concurrency level to the number of
 * processors or slightly higher. This can be achieved by setting the Java
 * system property with the name defined by CONCURRENCY_PROP_NAME to some
 * non-negative number. This will make use of the 'NativeServices' class and
 * supporting native libraries. See 'NativeServices' for details. See
 * 'CONCURRENCY_PROP_NAME' for the name of the property.
 *
 * <P>Initially the thread pool contains a user specified number of idle
 * threads. Idle threads can be given a target which is run. While running the
 * target the thread temporarily leaves the idle list. When the target
 * finishes, it joins the idle list again, waiting for a new target. When a
 * target is finished a thread can be notified on a particular object that is
 * given as a lock.
 *
 * <P>Jobs can be submitted using Runnable interfaces, using the 'runTarget()'
 * methods. When the job is submitted, an idle thread will be obtained, the
 * 'run()' method of the 'Runnable' interface will be executed and when it
 * completes the thread will be returned to the idle list. In general the
 * 'run()' method should complete in a rather short time, so that the threds
 * of the pool are not starved.
 *
 * <P>If using the non-asynchronous calls to 'runTarget()', it is important
 * that any target's 'run()' method, or any method called from it, does not
 * use non-asynchronous calls to 'runTarget()' on the same thread pool where
 * it was started. Otherwise this could create a dead-lock when there are not
 * enough idle threads.
 *
 * <P>The pool also has a global error and runtime exception condition (one
 * for 'Error' and one for 'RuntimeException'). If a target's 'run()' method
 * throws an 'Error' or 'RuntimeException' the corresponding exception
 * condition is set and the exception object saved. In any subsequent call to
 * 'checkTargetErrors()' the saved exception object is thrown. Likewise, if a
 * target's 'run()' method throws any other subclass of 'Throwable' a new
 * 'RuntimeException' is created and saved. It will be thrown on a subsequent
 * call to 'checkTargetErrors()'. If more than one exception occurs between
 * calls to 'checkTargetErrors()' only the last one is saved. Any 'Error'
 * condition has precedence on all 'RuntimeException' conditions. The threads
 * in the pool are unaffected by any exceptions thrown by targets.
 *
 * <P>The only exception to the above is the 'ThreadDeath' exception. If a
 * target's 'run()' method throws the 'ThreadDeath' exception a warning
 * message is printed and the exception is propagated, which will terminate
 * the thread in which it occurs. This could lead to instabilities of the
 * pool. The 'ThreadDeath' exception should never be thrown by the program. It
 * is thrown by the Java(TM) Virtual Machine when Thread.stop() is
 * called. This method is deprecated and should never be called.
 *
 * <P>All the threads in the pool are "daemon" threads and will automatically
 * terminate when no daemon threads are running.
