/**
 * This class presents a collection of static methods that allow access to
 * some native methods. It makes use of native methods to access those thread
 * properties.
 *
 * <P>Since the methods in this class require the presence of a shared library
 * with the name defined in SHLIB_NAME it is necessary to load it prior to
 * making use of any such methods. All methods that require the shared library
 * will automatically load the library if that has not been already done. The
 * library might also be manually loaded with the 'loadLibrary()' method of
 * this class.
 *
 * <P>This class provides only static methods. It should not be instantiated.
 *
 * <P>Currently the only native services available is settings relative to
 * POSIX threads, which are not accessible from the Java API.
 *
 * <P>Currently the methods in this class make sense with POSIX threads only,
 * since they access POSIX threads settings. POSIX threads are most used under
 * UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems and are mostly referred to as "native"
 * threads in Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementations.
 *
 * <P>The shared library SHLIB_NAME uses functions of the POSIX thread library
 * (i.e. 'pthread'). Calling the methods that use the 'pthread' library will
 * most prbably cause the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to crash if it is not
 * using the POSIX threads, due to unsatisfied references. For instance, JVMs
 * that use "green" threads will most certainly crash. POSIX threads are
 * referred to as "native" threads in JVMs under UNIX operating systems.
 *
 * <P>On Operating Systems where POSIX threads are not available (typically
 * Windows 95/98/NT/2000, MacIntosh, OS/2) there is no problem since the
 * SHLIB_NAME, if available, will not make use of POSIX threads library
 * functions, thus no problem should occur.

     * PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS scheduling scope. A concurrency level of 0 means
     * that the operating system will automatically adjust the concurrency
     * level depending on the number of threads blocking on system calls, but
     * this will probably not exploit more than one CPU in multiporocessor
