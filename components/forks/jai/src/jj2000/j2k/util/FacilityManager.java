/**
 * This class manages common facilities for mutithreading environments, It can
 * register different facilities for each thread, and also a default one, so
 * that they can be referred by static methods, while possibly having
 * different ones for different threads. Also a default facility exists that
 * is used for threads for which no particular facility has been registerd
 * registered.
 *
 * <P>Currently the only kind of facilities managed is MsgLogger.
 *
 * <P>An example use of this class is if 2 instances of a decoder are running
 * in different threads and the messages of the 2 instances should be
 * separated.
 *
 * <P>The default MsgLogger is a StreamMsgLogger that uses System.out as
 * the 'out' stream and System.err as the 'err' stream, and a line width of
 * 78. This can be changed using the registerMsgLogger() method.
