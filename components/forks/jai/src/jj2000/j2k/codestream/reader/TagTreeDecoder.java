/**
 * This class implements the tag tree decoder. A tag tree codes a 2D
 * matrix of integer elements in an efficient way. The decoding
 * procedure 'update()' updates a value of the matrix from a stream of
 * coded data, given a threshold. This procedure decodes enough
 * information to identify whether or not the value is greater than
 * or equal to the threshold, and updates the value accordingly.
 *
 * <P>In general the decoding procedure must follow the same sequence
 * of elements and thresholds as the encoding one. The encoder is
 * implemented by the TagTreeEncoder class.
 *
 * <P>Tag trees that have one dimension, or both, as 0 are allowed for
 * convenience. Of course no values can be set or coded in such cases.
