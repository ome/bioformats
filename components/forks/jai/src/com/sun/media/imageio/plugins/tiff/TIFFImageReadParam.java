/**
 * A subclass of {@link ImageReadParam} allowing control over
 * the TIFF reading process.
 *
 * <p> Because TIFF is an extensible format, the reader requires
 * information about any tags used by TIFF extensions in order to emit
 * meaningful metadata.  Also, TIFF extensions may define new
 * compression types.  Both types of information about extensions may
 * be provided by this interface.
 *
 * <p> Additional TIFF tags must be organized into
 * <code>TIFFTagSet</code>s.  A <code>TIFFTagSet</code> may be
 * provided to the reader by means of the
 * <code>addAllowedTagSet</code> method.  By default, the tag sets
 * <code>BaselineTIFFTagSet</code>, <code>FaxTIFFTagSet</code>,
 * <code>EXIFParentTIFFTagSet</code>, and <code>GeoTIFFTagSet</code>
 * are included.
 *
 * <p> New TIFF decompressors are handled in a simple fashion.  If a
 * non-<code>null</code> <code>TIFFDecompressor</code> is provided by
 * means of the setTIFFDecompressor method, it will override the
 * reader's usual choice of decompressor.  Thus, to read an image with
 * a non-standard compression type, the application should first
 * attempt to read the image's metadata and extract the compression
 * type.  The application may then use its own logic to choose a
 * suitable <code>TIFFDecompressor</code>, instantiate it, and pass it
 * to the <code>ImageReadParam</code> being used.  The reader's
 * <code>read</code> method may be called with the
 * <code>ImageReadParam</code> set.
