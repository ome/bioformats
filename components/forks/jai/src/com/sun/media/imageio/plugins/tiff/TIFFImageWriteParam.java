 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Old-style JPEG compression as described in section 22 of the TIFF 6.0
 * Specification is <i>not</i> supported.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p> The CCITT compression types are applicable to bilevel (1-bit)
 * images only.  The JPEG compression type is applicable to byte
 * grayscale (1-band) and RGB (3-band) images only.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * ZLib and Deflate compression are identical except for the value of the
 * TIFF Compression field: for ZLib the Compression field has value 8
 * whereas for Deflate it has value 32946 (0x80b2). In both cases each
 * image segment (strip or tile) is written as a single complete zlib data
 * stream.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * "EXIF JPEG" is a compression type used when writing the contents of an
 * APP1 EXIF marker segment for inclusion in a JPEG native image metadata
 * tree. The contents appended to the output when this compression type is
 * used are a function of whether an empty or non-empty image is written.
 * If the image is empty, then a TIFF IFD adhering to the specification of
 * a compressed EXIF primary IFD is appended. If the image is non-empty,
 * then a complete IFD and image adhering to the specification of a
 * compressed EXIF thumbnail IFD and image are appended. Note that the
 * data of the empty image may <i>not</i> later be appended using the pixel
 * replacement capability of the TIFF writer.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p> If ZLib/Deflate or JPEG compression is used, the compression quality
 * may be set. For ZLib/Deflate the supplied floating point quality value is
 * rescaled to the range <tt>[1,&nbsp;9]</tt> and truncated to an integer
 * to derive the Deflate compression level. For JPEG the floating point
 * quality value is passed directly to the JPEG writer plug-in which
 * interprets it in the usual way.</p>
 *
 * <p> The <code>canWriteTiles</code> and
 * <code>canWriteCompressed</code> methods will return
 * <code>true</code>; the <code>canOffsetTiles</code> and
 * <code>canWriteProgressive</code> methods will return
 * <code>false</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p> If tiles are being written, then each of their dimensions will be
 * rounded to the nearest multiple of 16 per the TIFF specification. If
 * JPEG-in-TIFF compression is being used, and tiles are being written
 * each tile dimension will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 8 times
 * the JPEG minimum coded unit (MCU) in that dimension. If JPEG-in-TIFF
 * compression is being used and strips are being written, the number of
 * rows per strip is rounded to a multiple of 8 times the maximum MCU over
 * both dimensions.</p>
