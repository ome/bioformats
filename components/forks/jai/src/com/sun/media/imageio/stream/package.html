Provides <code>ImageInputStream</code> and <code>ImageOutputStream</code>
classes for use with the Java Image I/O Framework. The
<code>FileChannel</code>-based classes use the new I/O {@link java.nio}
package to accelerate reading and writing of image data.

<h2>FileChannelImageInputStream</h2>

<code>FileChannelImageInputStream</code> uses memory mapping and NIO view
<code>Buffer</code>s to perform its data reading. It may be created by direct
instantiation given a <code>FileChannel</code> or via the Java Image I/O
plug-in mechanism, for example from
<code>ImageIO.createImageInputStream()</code>.

<p>A service provider is also registered which creates an
<code>ImageInputStream</code> given a
{@link java.nio.channels.ReadableByteChannel}. If the
<code>ReadableByteChannel</code> is a
<code>FileChannel</code> then the <code>ImageInputStream</code> will be a
<code>FileChannelImageInputStream</code>. Otherwise an
<code>InputStream</code> will be derived from the <code>Channel</code> and
wrapped by a <code>FileCacheImageInputStream</code> if a disk cache is being
used and does not cause a security violation, or a
<code>MemoryCacheImageInputStream</code> if disk caching is disabled or not
permitted.</p>

<h2>FileChannelImageOutputStream</h2>

<code>FileChannelImageOutputStream</code> uses memory mapping and NIO view
<code>Buffer</code>s to perform its data reading and direct NIO and view
<code>Buffer</code>s to perform its data writing. It may be created by direct
instantiation given a <code>FileChannel</code> or via the Java Image I/O
plug-in mechanism, for example from
<code>ImageIO.createImageOutputStream()</code>.

<p>A service provider is also registered which creates an
<code>ImageOutputStream</code> given a
{@link java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel}. If the
<code>WritableByteChannel</code> is a
<code>FileChannel</code> which has been opened for both reading and writing,
then the <code>ImageOutputStream</code> will be a
<code>FileChannelImageOutputStream</code>. Otherwise an
<code>OutputStream</code> will be derived from the <code>Channel</code> and
wrapped by a <code>FileCacheImageOutputStream</code> if a disk cache is being
used and does not cause a security violation, or a
<code>MemoryCacheImageOutputStream</code> if disk caching is disabled or not
permitted.</p>

<h2>RawImageInputStream</h2>

A <code>RawImageInputStream</code> provides a data input source for the
"raw" image format <code>ImageReader</code> plug-in. The
<code>RawImageInputStream</code> constructor which requires an
{@link org.xml.sax.InputSource} parameter allows an application to use
a pre-established XML description of the raw image file. This may be useful
in cases where groups of files have the same layout in which case identical
or similar XML description files may be re-used. Such a description file
would be used to create a <code>FileInputStream</code> from which the
<code>InputSource</code> would be created.

<h2>SegmentedImageInputStream</h2>

A <code>SegmentedImageInputStream</code> provides a contiguous view of
another <code>ImageInputStream</code> which itself consists of a sequence of
discontiguous segments containing the image data of interest. Such a stream
may be used for example in conjunction with a <code>RawImageInputStream</code>
to enable reading from a data source which has non-image data interspersed
with the image data. For example, an image could be stored in a line-oriented
fashion with prefix data such as a time stamp embedded in each line.
