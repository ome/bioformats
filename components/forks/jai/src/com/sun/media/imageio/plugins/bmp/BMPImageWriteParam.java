/**
 * A subclass of <code>ImageWriteParam</code> for encoding images in
 * the BMP format.
 *
 * <p> This class allows for the specification of various parameters
 * while writing a BMP format image file.  By default, the data layout 
 * is bottom-up, such that the pixels are stored in bottom-up order, 
 * the first scanline being stored last.
 *
 * <p>The particular compression scheme to be used can be specified by using
 * the <code>setCompressionType()</code> method with the appropriate type
 * string.  The compression scheme specified will be honored if and only if it
 * is compatible with the type of image being written. If the specified 
 * compression scheme is not compatible with the type of image being written
 * then the <code>IOException</code> will be thrown by the BMP image writer.
 * If the compression type is not set explicitly then <code>getCompressionType()</code>
 * will return <code>null</code>. In this case the BMP image writer will select 
 * a compression type that supports encoding of the given image without loss
 * of the color resolution.
 * <p>The compression type strings and the image type(s) each supports are
 * listed in the following
 * table:
 *
 * <p><table border=1>
 * <caption><b>Compression Types</b></caption>
 * <tr><th>Type String</th> <th>Description</th>  <th>Image Types</th></tr>
 * <tr><td>BI_RGB</td>  <td>Uncompressed RLE</td> <td><= 8-bits/sample</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>BI_RLE8</td> <td>8-bit Run Length Encoding</td> <td><= 8-bits/sample</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>BI_RLE4</td> <td>4-bit Run Length Encoding</td> <td><= 4-bits/sample</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>BI_BITFIELDS</td> <td>Packed data</td> <td> 16 or 32 bits/sample</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>BI_JPEG</td> <td>JPEG encoded</td> <td>grayscale or RGB image</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p> When <code>BI_BITFIELDS</code> is used, if the image encoded has a
 * <code>DirectColorModel</code>, the bit mask in the color model will be
 * written into the stream.  Otherwise, only 5-5-5 16-bit image or 8-8-8 
 * 32-bit images are supported.
