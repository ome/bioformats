/**
 * A <code>SegmentedImageInputStream</code> provides a view of a

 * of segments with given starting positions in the source stream and
 * lengths.  The resulting stream behaves like an ordinary
 * <code>ImageInputStream</code>.
 *
 * <p> For example, given a <code>ImageInputStream</code> containing
 * data in a format consisting of a number of sub-streams stored in
 * non-contiguous sectors indexed by a directory, it is possible to
 * construct a set of <code>SegmentedImageInputStream</code>s, one for
 * each sub-stream, that each provide a view of the sectors comprising
 * a particular stream by providing the positions and lengths of the
 * stream's sectors as indicated by the directory.  The complex
 * multi-stream structure of the original stream may be ignored by
 * users of the <code>SegmentedImageInputStream</code>, who see a
 * separate <code>ImageInputStream</code> for each sub-stream and do not
 * need to understand the directory structure at all.
 *
 * <p> For further efficiency, a directory structure such as in the
 * example described above need not be fully parsed in order to build
 * a <code>SegmentedImageInputStream</code>.  Instead, the
 * <code>StreamSegmentMapper</code> interface allows the association
 * between a desired region of the output and an input segment to be
 * provided dynamically.  This mapping might be computed by reading
 * from a directory in piecemeal fashion in order to avoid consuming
 * memory resources.
