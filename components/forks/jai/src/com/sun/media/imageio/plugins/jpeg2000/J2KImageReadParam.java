 *    The default is <code>Double.MAX_VALUE</code>.

 *    is greater than the number of available resolution levels of the
 *    compressed image, the decoded image has the lowest available
 *    resolution (among all tile-components).  This parameter affects only
 *    the inverse wavelet transform and not the number of bytes read by the
 *    codestream parser, which depends only on <code>decodingRate</code>.
