 * <caption><b>JPEG 2000 Plugin Decoding Parameters</b></caption>
 * <tr><th>Parameter Name</th> <th>Description</th></tr>
 * <tr>
 *    <td>decodingRate</td>
 *    <td>Specifies the decoding rate in bits per pixel (bpp) where the
 *    number of pixels is related to the image's original size (Note:
 *    this parameter is not affected by <code>resolution</code>).  The
 *    codestream is either parsed (default) or truncated depending
 *    <code>parsingEnabled</code>.  The default is <code>Double.MAX_VALUE</code>.
 *    It means decoding with the encoding rate.
 *    </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *    <td>resolution</td>
 *    <td>Specifies the resolution level wanted for the decoded image
 *    (0 means the lowest available resolution, the resolution
 *    level gives an image with the original dimension).  If the given index
 *    is greater than the number of available resolution levels of the
 *    compressed image, the decoded image has the lowest available
 *    resolution (among all tile-components).  This parameter affects only
 *    the inverse wavelet transform and not the number of bytes read by the
 *    codestream parser, which depends only on <code>decodingRate</code>.
 *    </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *    <td>noROIDescaling</td>
 *    <td>Ensures that no ROI de-scaling is performed.  Decompression is done
 *    like there is no ROI in the image.
 *    </td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 *    <td>parsingEnabled</td>
 *    <td>Enable the parsing mode or not when the decoding rate is specified.
 *    If it is false, the codestream is decoded as if it were truncated to
 *    the given rate.  If it is true, the decoder creates, truncates and
 *    decodes a virtual layer progressive codestream with the same
 *    truncation points in each code-block.
 *    </td>
 * </tr>
