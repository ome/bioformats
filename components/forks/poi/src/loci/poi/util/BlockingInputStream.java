/**
 * Implementation of a BlockingInputStream to provide data to 
 * RawDataBlock that expects data in 512 byte chunks.  Useful to read
 * data from slow (ie, non FileInputStream) sources, for example when 
 * reading an OLE2 Document over a network. 
 *
 * Possible extentions: add a timeout. Curently a call to read(byte[]) on this
 *    class is blocking, so use at your own peril if your underlying stream blocks.
