/**
 * Abstract superclass of all {@link LegacyAdapter} implementations.
 * <p>
 * Uses a {@link WeakHashMap} implementation for maintaining associations between
 * legacy and modern classes. "True" instances of each class map to wrappers of their
 * companion classes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NB: because wrappers are the values in the map, they must be expected to delegate to their key
 * objects (wrapper values wrap their keys). <br>WeakHashMaps are used to ensure garbage collection when
 * there are no other references to the Legacy/modern pairings. <br>However, since the values in each
 * pairing wraps the key, there is always a strong reference to each key. Thus we map each key 
 * to a {@link WeakReference} of the wrapper.
