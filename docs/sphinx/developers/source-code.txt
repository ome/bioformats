Source code
===========

If you are interested in the latest Bio-Formats source code from our
`Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ repository, you can access it using the
repository path:

You can also browse the Bio-Formats source on GitHub:

To build the code, you can use our Ant build script—try "``ant -p``\ "
for a list of targets.  In general, "ant jars" or "ant tools" is the
correct command.

Lastly, you can browse the :javadoc:`Bio-Formats Javadocs online <>`,
or generate them yourself using the "docs" Ant target.
