Bio-Formats service and dependency infrastructure
=================================================

Description
-----------

The Bio-Formats service infrastructure is an interface driven pattern
for dealing with external and internal dependencies. The design goal was
mainly to avoid the cumbersome usage of ``ReflectedUniverse`` where
possible and to clearly define both service dependency and interface
between components. This is generally referred to as `dependency
injection <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection>`_,
`dependency
inversion <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle>`_
or `component based
design <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component-based_software_engineering>`_.

It was decided, at this point, to forgo the usage of potentially more
powerful but also more complicated solutions such as:

-  Spring (http://spring.io)
-  Guice (http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/)
-  ...

The Wikipedia page for `dependency
injection <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection>`_ contains
many other implementations in many languages.

An added benefit is the potential code reuse possibilities as a result
of decoupling of dependency and usage in Bio-Formats readers.
Implementations of the initial Bio-Formats services were completed as
part of BioFormatsCleanup and tickets :ticket:`463` and :ticket:`464`.

Writing a service
-----------------

-  **Interface** -- The basic form of a service is an interface which
   inherits from :common_javadoc:`loci.common.services.Service <loci/common/services/Service.html>`.
   Here is a very basic example using the (now removed) ``OMENotesService``

   ::

       public interface OMENotesService extends Service {

         /**
          * Creates a new OME Notes instance.
          * @param filename Path to the file to create a Notes instance for.
          */
         public void newNotes(String filename);

       }

-  **Implementation** -- This service then has an implementation, which
   is usually located in the Bio-Formats component or package which
   imports classes from an external, dynamic or other dependency. Again
   looking at the ``OMENotesService``:

   ::

       public class OMENotesServiceImpl extends AbstractService
         implements OMENotesService {

         /**
          * Default constructor.
          */
         public OMENotesServiceImpl() {
           checkClassDependency(Notes.class);
         }

         /* (non-Javadoc)
          * @see loci.formats.dependency.OMENotesService#newNotes()
          */
         public void newNotes(String filename) {
           new Notes(null, filename);
         }

       }

-  **Style**

   -  Extension of ``AbstractService`` to enable uniform runtime
      dependency checking is recommended. Java does not check class
      dependencies until classes are first instantiated so if you do not
      do this, you may end up with ``ClassNotFound`` or the like
      exceptions being emitted from your service methods. This is to be
      **strongly** discouraged. If a service has unresolvable classes on
      its CLASSPATH instantiation should fail, not service method
      invocation.
   -  Service methods should not burden the implementer with numerous
      checked exceptions. Also external dependency exception instances
      should not be allowed to directly leak from a service interface.
      Please wrap these using a ``ServiceException``.
   -  By convention both the interface and implementation are expected
      to be in a package named ``loci.*.services``. This is not a hard
      requirement but should be followed where possible.

-  **Registration** -- A service's interface and implementation must
   finally be *registered* with the
   :common_javadoc:`loci.common.services.ServiceFactory <loci/common/services/ServiceFactory.html>`
   via the :file:`services.properties` file. Following the ``OMENotesService``
   again, here is an example registration:

   ::

       ...
       # OME notes service (implementation in legacy ome-notes component)
       loci.common.services.OMENotesService=loci.ome.notes.services.OMENotesServiceImpl
       ...

Using a service
---------------

::

    OMENotesService service = null;
    try {
      ServiceFactory factory = new ServiceFactory();
      service = factory.getInstance(OMENotesService.class);
    }
    catch (DependencyException de) {
      LOGGER.info("", de);
    }
    ...
