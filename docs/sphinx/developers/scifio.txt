SCientific Imaging Formats Input and Output
===========================================


SCIFIO is a refactoring of :doc:`Bio-Formats </about/index>`.
Classic Bio-Formats uses :model_doc:`OME-XML <ome-xml>` to model the metadata
for a given image, standardizing all supported formats to this schema. This
tight integration, along with the naming itself of Bio-Formats, discourages
potential users from outside the life sciences (if their imaging requirements
include metadata outside the OME-XML specification). Furthermore, the steps of
processing image formats are obfuscated by their consolidation into a single
**Reader** class; this increases the entry barrier for 3rd party developers to
add support for additional formats. Finally, the GPL licensing of Bio-Formats
precludes its inclusion in non-GPL software packages such as ImageJ, ITK,
VCell and VisAD.

SCIFIO aims to resolve these issues by reversing the OME-XML dependency
and teasing apart the stages of image format conversion and processing.
SCIFIO will define the core components of flexible image format support.
OME-XML will become one type of metadata, which Bio-Formats will still
use to standardize the metadata of a wide variety of image formats. Thus
Bio-Formats will become an extension to SCIFIO, but the underlying
structure will allow any number of such extensions to coexist. Dynamic
discovery mechanisms will allow these modules to be used as needed, as
long as the underlying program incorporates the SCIFIO core. Further,
the SCIFIO core will include support only for the open source formats
currently supported by Bio-Formats, allowing distribution under the BSD
license (though individual modules can fall under any licensing
framework, and Bio-Formats will continue to have a dual GPL + commercial
license).
