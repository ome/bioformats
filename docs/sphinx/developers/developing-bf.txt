Developing Bio-Formats
======================

If you are interested in working on the Bio-Formats source code itself,
you can load it into your favorite IDE, or develop with your favorite
text editor.

The Bio-Formats code is divided into several projects. Core components
are located in subfolders of the :source:`components <components/>` folder,
with some components further classified into :source:`components/forks
<components/forks/>` or :source:`components/stubs <components/stubs/>`,
depending on the nature of the project.

Each project has a corresponding Maven POM file, which can be used to
work with the project in your favorite IDE, or from the command line,
once you have cloned the source. Instructions for several popular
options follow.

NetBeans
--------

NetBeans comes with Maven support built in. To import the Bio-Formats
source, perform the following steps:

#. Choose :menuselection:`File --> Open Project` from the menu
#. Select the top-level folder of your Bio-Formats working copy
#. Expand the Modules folder and double-click desired project(s) to work
   with them

Alternately, you can clone the source directly from NetBeans into a
project by selecting :menuselection:`Team --> Git --> Clone Other...` from
the menu.

Eclipse
-------

Eclipse uses the "Maven Integration for Eclipse" (m2e) plugin to work with
Maven projects. It is more flexible than Eclipse's built-in project
management because m2e transparently converts between project dependencies
and JAR dependencies (stored in the Maven repository in
:file:`~/.m2/repository`) on the build path, depending on which projects are
currently open.

We recommend using Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler), specifically -
"Eclipse IDE for Java developers". It comes with m2e installed
(http://eclipse.org/downloads/compare.php?release=kepler).

You can then import the Bio-Formats source by choosing
:menuselection:`File --> Import --> Existing Maven Projects` from the menu
and browsing to the top-level folder of your Bio-Formats working copy.

Command line
------------

If you prefer developing code with a text editor such as vim or emacs,
you can use the Ant or Maven command line tools to compile Bio-Formats.
The Bio-Formats source tree provides parallel build systems for both Ant
and Maven, so you can use either one to build the code.

For a list of Ant targets, run:

``ant -p``

When using Maven, Bio-Formats is configured to run the "install" target
by default, so all JARs will be copied into your local Maven repository
in ~/.m2/repository. Simply run:

``mvn``

With either Ant or Maven, you can use similar commands in any subproject
folder to build just that component.
