Build instructions for C++ bindings
===================================

This package provides language bindings for calling into the Bio-Formats Java
library from C++ in a cross-platform manner. As of this writing the bindings
are functional with GCC on Linux and Mac OS X systems, as well as with Visual
C++ 2005 and Visual C++ 2008 on Windows.

We provide binary builds of the C++ bindings for various platforms, accessible
from the :bf_plone:`Bio-Formats downloads page <downloads>`.

Alternately, if you wish to build the Bio-Formats C++ bindings from source, see the directions below.


Compile-time dependencies
-------------------------

To build the Bio-Formats C++ bindings, the following modules are required:

- `Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`_
    Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Along with
    Ant, it is one of the supported build systems for the Bio-Formats Java
    library, and is used to generate the Bio-Formats C++ bindings.

- `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_
    CMake is a cross-platform, open source build system generator, commonly 
    used to build C++ projects in a platform-independent manner. CMake 
    supports GNU make as well as Microsoft Visual Studio, allowing the 
    Bio-Formats C++ bindings to be compiled on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and  
    potentially other platforms.

- `Boost Thread <http://www.boost.org/>`_
    Boost is a project providing open source portable C++ source libraries. It 
    has become a suite of de facto standard libraries for C++. The Bio-Formats  
    C++ bindings require the Boost Thread module in order to handle C++ 
    threads in a platform independent way.

- `Java Development Kit <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/>`_
    At runtime, only the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is necessary to 
    execute the Bio-Formats code. However, the full J2SE development kit is 
    required at compile time on some platforms (Windows in particular), since 
    it comes bundled with the JVM shared library (jvm.lib) necessary to link 
    with Java.

For information on installing these dependencies, refer to the page for your
specific platform: 
:doc:`Windows <BF-CPP-windows>`,
:doc:`Mac OS X <BF-CPP-macosx>`,
:doc:`Linux <BF-CPP-linux>`.

How to build
------------

The process of building the Bio-Formats C++ bindings is divided into two steps:

1) Generate a C++ project consisting of "proxies" which wrap the Java code.
   This step utilizes the Maven project management tool, specifically a
   Maven plugin called cppwrap.

2) Compile this generated C++ project. This step utilizes the cross-platform
   CMake build system.

For details on executing these build steps, refer to the page for your
specific platform: 
:doc:`Windows <BF-CPP-windows>`,
:doc:`Mac OS X <BF-CPP-macosx>`,
:doc:`Linux <BF-CPP-linux>`.

Build results
-------------

If all goes well, the build system will:

1) Generate the Bio-Formats C++ proxy classes;
2) Build the Jace C++ library;
3) Build the Java Tools C++ library;
4) Build the Bio-Formats C++ shared library;
5) Build the showinf and minimum_writer command line tools,
   for testing the functionality.

Please be patient, as the build may require several minutes to complete.

Afterwards, the dist/scifio subdirectory will contain the following files:

1) libjace.so / libjace.jnilib / jace.dll :
     Jace shared library

2) libscifio.so / libscifio.dylib / scifio.dll :
     SCIFIO C++ shared library

3) jace-runtime.jar :
     Jace Java classes needed at runtime

4) loci_tools.jar :
     Bio-Formats Java library needed at runtime

5) libjtools.so / libjtools.jnilib / jtools.dll :
     Java Tools shared library

6) showinf / showinf.exe :
     Example command line application

7) minimum_writer / minimum_writer.exe :
     Example command line application

Items 1-4 are necessary and required to deploy Bio-Formats with your C++
application. Item 5 (jtools) is a useful helper library for managing the Java
virtual machine from C++, but is not strictly necessary to use Bio-Formats.
All other files, including the example programs and various build files
generated by CMake, are not needed.

If you prefer, instead of using the loci_tools.jar bundle, you can provide
individual JAR files as appropriate for your application. For details, see :doc:`using Bio-Formats as a Java library <java-library>`.
