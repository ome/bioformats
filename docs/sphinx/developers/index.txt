The following sections describe various things that are useful to know when
working with Bio-Formats. It is recommended that you obtain the
Bio-Formats source by following the directions in the
:ref:`source-code` section. Referring to the :javadoc:`Javadocs <>` as you
read over these pages should help, as the notes will make more sense when you
see the API.

For a complete list of supported formats, see the Bio-Formats
:doc:`supported formats table </supported-formats>`.

For a few working examples of how to use Bio-Formats, see
:sourcedir:`these Github pages <components/formats-gpl/utils>`.
