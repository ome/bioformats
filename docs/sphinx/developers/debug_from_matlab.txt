Hints on debugging Bio-Formats when invoked from Matlab.
============================================================= 

A few notes on how to setup to debit Bio-Formats code when invoked from Matlab.

Steps are as follows (NB Currently only tested using Netbeans & OSX.)

1) Invoke Matlab from the command line with the -jdb option.

	On OSX :
	/Applications/MATLAB_R2013b.app/bin/matlab -jdb

2) Find pid for matlab 
	On OSX : ps -ax | grep LAB

2) In Netbeans select the required project (e.g. bioformats_package bundle)
    Set breakpoints then Debug->Attach Debugger.
	Change Connector field to ProcessAttach(Attaches to debuggee by process-id (pid).
    & Process ID field to PID from 2 (above)

3) Call java process from Matlab window as normal.
