Writing files
=============

The following file formats can be written using Bio-Formats:

- TIFF (uncompressed, LZW, JPEG, or JPEG-2000)
- OME-TIFF (uncompressed, LZW, JPEG, or JPEG-2000)
- JPEG
- PNG
- AVI (uncompressed)
- QuickTime (uncompressed is supported natively; additional codecs use QTJava)
- Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)
- OME-XML (not recommended)

The writer API (see :source:`loci.formats.IFormatWriter
<components/formats-api/src/loci/formats/IFormatWriter.java>`) is very similar to 
the reader
API, in that files are written one plane at time (rather than all at once).

All writers allow the output file to be changed before the last plane has
been written.  This allows you to write to any number of output files using
the same writer and output settings (compression, frames per second, etc.),
and is especially useful for formats that do not support multiple images per
file.

Please see :source:`loci.formats.tools.ImageConverter <components/bio-formats-tools/src/loci/formats/tools/ImageConverter.java>` and 
:doc:`this guide to exporting to OME-TIFF files <export2>` for examples of how 
to write files.
