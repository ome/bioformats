Units of measurement
====================

Since Bio-Formats 5.1 and the adoption of the 2015-01 OME Data Model,
the data model and the corresponding Bio-Formats model and metadata
APIs have added support for units of measurement.  Previously, the
units for various properties such as the physical size of an image,
stage position, confocal pinhole size, light wavelengths etc. were
fixed in the model.  This was however somewhat inflexible, and not
appropriate for imaging modalities at widely different scales, and the
solution to this was to add a unit of measurement to each of these
properties.  The image size, for example, was previously specified to
be stored in micrometers but may now be specified in any SI length
unit of choice, or one of the supported non-SI length units.  This
permits the preservation of the unit used by a proprietary file format
or used at acquisition time, for example nanometers, millimeters,
meters, or inches or thousandths of an inch could be used instead.

At the OME-XML level, the properties continue to use the old attribute
names. They are supplemented by an additional attribute with a
``Unit`` suffix, for example the ``PhysicalSizeX`` attribute and its
companion ``PhysicalSizeXUnit`` attribute.

At the API level, two classes are used:

``Unit<T>``
  represents a unit system for a given dimension such as length, pressure or time.
``Quantity``
  represents a value and unit in a given unit system; this is
  subclassed for each of the supported dimensions such as ``Length``,
  ``Pressure`` etc.  For example the ``Length`` class could represent
  the value and unit of 5.3 µm and the ``Pressure`` class 956 mbar.

All of the model and metadata APIs pass ``Quantity`` objects in place
of raw numerical values.  Updating your code will require replacing
the use of raw values with quantities.  Where your code needs to deal
with the quantity in a specific unit, for example µm, you will need to
perform an explicit unit conversion to transform the value to the
required unit.

The three situations you will need to deal with are:

- getting a quantity from a ``get`` method in the API
- converting a quantity to a desired unit
- setting a quantity with a ``set`` method in the API (possibly also
  requiring the creation of a quantity)

Examples of how to use units and quantities for these purposes are
shown in the sections :ref:`reading_files` (``ReadPhysicalSize``
example which uses ``getPixelsPhysicalSize`` and also demonstrates
unit conversion) and :ref:`writing_files_details`
(``setPixelsPhysicalSize``).
