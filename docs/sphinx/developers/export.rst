Exporting files using Bio-Formats
=================================

This guide pertains to version 4.2 and later.

Basic conversion
----------------

The first thing we need to do is set up a reader:

::

      // create a reader that will automatically handle any supported format
      IFormatReader reader = new ImageReader();
      // tell the reader where to store the metadata from the dataset
      MetadataStore metadata;

      try {
        ServiceFactory factory = new ServiceFactory();
        OMEXMLService service = factory.getInstance(OMEXMLService.class);
        metadata = service.createOMEXMLMetadata();
      }
      catch (DependencyException exc) {
        throw new FormatException("Could not create OME-XML store.", exc);
      }
      catch (ServiceException exc) {
        throw new FormatException("Could not create OME-XML store.", exc);
      }

      reader.setMetadataStore(metadata);
      // initialize the dataset
      reader.setId("/path/to/file");

Now, we set up our writer:

::

      // create a writer that will automatically handle any supported output format
      IFormatWriter writer = new ImageWriter();
      // give the writer a MetadataRetrieve object, which encapsulates all of the
      // dimension information for the dataset (among many other things)
      writer.setMetadataRetrieve(MetadataTools.asRetrieve(reader.getMetadataStore()));
      // initialize the writer
      writer.setId("/path/to/output/file");

Note that the extension of the file name passed to 'writer.setId(â€¦)'
determines the file format of the exported file.

Now that everything is set up, we can start writing planes:

::

      for (int series=0; series<reader.getSeriesCount(); series++) {
        reader.setSeries(series);
        writer.setSeries(series);

        for (int image=0; image<reader.getImageCount(); image++) {
          writer.saveBytes(image, reader.openBytes(image));
        }
      }

Finally, make sure to close both the reader and the writer. Failure to
do so can cause:

-  file handle leaks
-  memory leaks
-  truncated output files

Fortunately, closing the files is very easy:

::

      reader.close();
      writer.close();

Converting large images
-----------------------

The flaw in the previous example is that it requires an image plane to
be fully read into memory before it can be saved. In many cases this is
fine, but if you are working with very large images (especially > 4 GB)
this is problematic. The solution is to break each image plane into a
set of reasonably-sized tiles and save each tile separately - thus
substantially reducing the amount of memory required for conversion.

For now, we'll assume that your tile size is 1024 x 1024, though in
practice you will likely want to adjust this. Assuming you have an
IFormatReader and IFormatWriter set up as in the previous example, let's
start writing planes:

::

      int tileWidth = 1024;
      int tileHeight = 1024;

      for (int series=0; series<reader.getSeriesCount(); series++) {
        reader.setSeries(series);
        writer.setSeries(series);

        // determine how many tiles are in each image plane
        // for simplicity, we'll assume that the image width and height are
        // multiples of 1024

        int tileRows = reader.getSizeY() / tileHeight;
        int tileColumns = reader.getSizeX() / tileWidth;

        for (int image=0; image<reader.getImageCount(); image++) {
          for (int row=0; row<tileRows; row++) {
            for (int col=0; col<tileColumns; col++) {
              // open a tile - in addition to the image index, we need to specify
              // the (x, y) coordinate of the upper left corner of the tile,
              // along with the width and height of the tile

              int xCoordinate = col * tileWidth;
              int yCoordinate = row * tileHeight;
              byte[] tile =
                reader.openBytes(image, xCoordinate, yCoordinate, tileWidth, tileHeight);
              writer.saveBytes(
                image, tile, xCoordinate, yCoordinate, tileWidth, tileHeight);
            }
          }
        }
      }

As noted, the example assumes that the width and height of the image are
multiples of the tile dimensions. Be careful, as this is not always the
case; the last column and/or row may be smaller than preceding
columns/rows. An exception will be thrown if you attempt to read or
write a tile that is not completely contained by the original image
plane. Most writers perform best if the tile width is equal to the image
width, although specifying any valid width should work.

As before, you need to close the reader and writer.

Converting to multiple files
----------------------------

The recommended method of converting to multiple files is to use a
single IFormatWriter, like so:

::

      // you should have set up a reader as in the first example
      ImageWriter writer = new ImageWriter();
      writer.setMetadataRetrieve(MetadataTools.asRetrieve(reader.getMetadataStore()));
      // replace this with your own filename definitions
      // in this example, we're going to write half of the planes to one file
      // and half of the planes to another file
      String[] outputFiles =
        new String[] {"/path/to/file/1.tiff", "/path/to/file/2.tiff"};
      writer.setId(outputFiles[0]);

      int planesPerFile = reader.getImageCount() / outputFiles.length;
      for (int file=0; file<outputFiles.length; file++) {
        writer.changeOutputFile(outputFiles[file]);
        for (int image=0; image<planesPerFile; image++) {
          int index = file * planesPerFile + image;
          writer.saveBytes(image, reader.openBytes(index));
        }
      }

      reader.close();
      writer.close();

The advantage here is that the relationship between the files is
preserved when converting to formats that support multi-file datasets
internally (namely OME-TIFF). If you are only converting to graphics
formats (e.g. JPEG, AVI, MOV), then you could also use a separate
IFormatWriter for each file, like this:

::

      // again, you should have set up a reader already
      String[] outputFiles = new String[] {"/path/to/file/1.avi", "/path/to/file/2.avi"};
      int planesPerFile = reader.getImageCount() / outputFiles.length;
      for (int file=0; file<outputFiles.length; file++) {
        ImageWriter writer = new ImageWriter();
        writer.setMetadataRetrieve(MetadataTools.asRetrieve(reader.getMetadataStore()));
        writer.setId(outputFiles[file]);
        for (int image=0; image<planesPerFile; image++) {
          int index = file * planesPerFile + image;
          writer.saveBytes(image, reader.openBytes(index));
        }
        writer.close();
      }
