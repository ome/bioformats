Bio-Formats C++ bindings
========================

To make Bio-Formats accessible to software written in C++, we have
created a Bio-Formats C++ interface (BF-CPP for short). It uses LOCI's
`jar2lib <http://loci.wisc.edu/software/jar2lib>`_ program to generate a C++
proxy class for each equivalent Bio-Formats Java class. The resulting proxies
are then compiled into a library, which represents the actual interface from
C++ to Bio-Formats. Using this library in your projects gives you access to
the image support of Bio-Formats.

BF-CPP comes with some standalone examples which you can use as a
starting point in your own project:

-  :source:`showinf <components/scifio/cppwrap/showinf.cpp>`
-  :source:`minimum_writer <components/scifio/cppwrap/minimum_writer.cpp>`

Other projects using BF-CPP include:

-  `WiscScan <http://loci.wisc.edu/software/wiscscan>`_ which uses BF-CPP
   to write :model_doc:`OME-TIFF <ome-tiff>` files.
-  :doc:`/users/xuvtools/index` which uses an adapted version of BF-CPP
   called
   `BlitzBioFormats <http://www.xuvtools.org/devel:libblitzbioformats>`_.

See the :doc:`build instructions <buildBF-CPP>` 
(:doc:`Windows <BF-CPP-windows>`, :doc:`Mac OS X <BF-CPP-macosx>`, 
:doc:`Linux <BF-CPP-linux>`) for details on compiling BF-CPP from source. Once 
this is done, simply include it in your project as you would any other 
external library.
