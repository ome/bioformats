Bio-Formats as a Java library
=============================


API documentation
-----------------

If you wish to make use of Bio-Formats within your own software, you can
download bio-formats.jar to use it as a library. Just add
**bio-formats.jar** to your CLASSPATH or build path. You will also need
**loci-common.jar** for common I/O functions. :doc:`Read more...<java-library>`. 

Also see :Jenkins:`further Bio-Formats Java documentation <job/BIOFORMATS-trunk/javadoc/>`

Interfacing from non-Java code
==============================


Bio-Formats is written in Java, and is easiest to use with other Java
code. However, it is possible to call Bio-Formats from a program written
in another language. But how to do so depends on your program's needs.

Bio-Formats C++ bindings
------------------------

To make the utility of the Bio-Formats Java library accessible to
software written in C++ (such as the Insight Toolkit) we have used the
Jace set of libraries to create C++ proxies of the Bio-Formats classes.

Writing new Bio-Formats file format readers
===========================================

A brief guide to writing new Bio-Formats file format readers is available. All format readers should extend either loci.formats.FormatReader or a reader
in loci.formats.in. :doc:Read more... <reader-guide>`


Contributing to Bio-Formats
===========================


If you are interested in working on the Bio-Formats source code itself,
you can load the source code into your favorite IDE, or develop code
with your favorite text editor. :doc:`Read
