Generating test images
======================

Sometimes it is nice to have a file of a specific size or pixel type for
testing. To generate a file (that contains gradient images):

::

    touch "my-special-test-file&pixelType=uint8&sizeZ=1&sizeC=1&sizeT=1&sizeX=8192&sizeY=8192.fake"

Whatever is before the `&` is the image name; remaining key value pairs
should be pretty self-explanatory. Just replace the values with whatever
you need for testing.

There are a few other keys that can be added as well:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{3cm}|p{11cm}|

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 30, 70

    - * Key
      * Value
    - * bitsPerPixel
      * number of valid bits (<= number of bits implied by pixel type)
    - * rgb
      * number of channels that are merged together
    - * dimOrder
      * dimension order (e.g. XYZCT)
    - * little
      * whether or not the pixel data should be little-endian
    - * interleaved
      * whether or not merged channels are interleaved
    - * indexed
      * whether or not a color lookup table is present
    - * falseColor
      * whether or not the color lookup table is just for making the image look pretty
    - * series
      * number of series (Images)
    - * lutLength
      * number of entries in the color lookup table

You can often work with the .fake file directly, but in some cases
support for those files is disabled and so you will need to convert the
file to something else. Make sure that you have Bio-Formats built and
the JARs in your :envvar:`CLASSPATH` (individual JARs or just loci_tools.jar):

::

    bfconvert my-special-test-file&pixelType=uint8&sizeZ=1&sizeC=1&sizeT=1&sizeX=8192&sizeY=8192.fake my-special-test-file.tiff

If you do not have the command line tools installed, substitute
:source:`loci.formats.tools.ImageConverter <components/scifio/src/loci/formats/tools/ImageConverter.java>` for `bfconvert`.
