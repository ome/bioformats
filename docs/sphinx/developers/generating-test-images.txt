Generating test images
======================

Sometimes it is nice to have a file of a specific size or pixel type for
testing. To generate an image file (that contains a gradient image):

::

    touch "my-special-test-file&pixelType=uint8&sizeX=8192&sizeY=8192.fake"

Whatever is before the first ``&`` is the image name; the remaining key-value
pairs, each preceded with ``&``, set the pixel type and image dimensions. Just
replace the values with whatever you need for testing.

Additionally, you can put such values in a separate :file:`.ini` file:

::

    touch my-special-test-file.fake
    echo "pixelType=uint8" >> my-special-test-file.fake.ini
    echo "sizeX=8192" >> my-special-test-file.fake.ini
    echo "sizeY=8192" >> my-special-test-file.fake.ini

In fact, just the :file:`.fake.ini` file alone suffices:

::

    echo "pixelType=uint8" >> my-special-test-file.fake.ini
    echo "sizeX=8192" >> my-special-test-file.fake.ini
    echo "sizeY=8192" >> my-special-test-file.fake.ini

If you include a "[GlobalMetadata]" section to the ini file,
then all the included values will be accessible from the
global metadata map:

::

    echo "[GlobalMetadata]" >> my-special-test-file.fake.ini
    echo "my.key=some.value" >> my-special-test-file.fake.ini

To generate a simple plate file:

::

    touch "plate-test-file&plates=1&plateAcqs=1&plateRows=1&plateCols=1&fields=1.fake"

This will create a single plate which is, by default, within a containing
screen. To create a plate with no containing screen add ``&screens=0`` to the
key-value pairs in the file name. As above a :file:`.fake.ini` file can be
used.

To generate a valid plate the values of ``plates``, ``plateAcqs``,
``plateRows``, ``plateCols`` and ``fields`` must **all** be greater than zero.
If this condition is not met then an image will be generated instead of a
plate.

There are several other keys that can be added as well, these are listed below
with their default values.

You can often work with the .fake file directly, but in some cases
support for those files is disabled and so you will need to convert the
file to something else. Make sure that you have Bio-Formats built and
the JARs in your :envvar:`CLASSPATH` (individual JARs or just
:file:`bioformats_package.jar`):

::

    bfconvert test&pixelType=uint8&sizeX=8192&sizeY=8192.fake test.tiff

If you do not have the command line tools installed, substitute
:source:`loci.formats.tools.ImageConverter <components/bio-formats-tools/src/loci/formats/tools/ImageConverter.java>`
for :program:`bfconvert`.
