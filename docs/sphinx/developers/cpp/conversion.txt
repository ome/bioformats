C++ conversion details
======================

The C++ codebase has been primarily a conversion of the original Java
codebase, with some additional helper functions and classes added
where needed.  The intention is that the basic interfaces and classes
should be identical between the two languages unless this is prevented
by fundamental differences between the languages.

This section is intended to be useful for

- Users of the existing Java interface, who wish to understand the
  differences between the two implementations
- Developers who wish to work on the C++ interface

In addition to documenting the specific language and class
compatibility issues, this section also documents the idioms in use in
the C++ code which might not be immediately clear by looking at the
API reference, and which may not be familiar to Java developers.


C++ and Java type incompatibility
---------------------------------

While C++ and Java have some basic syntactical similarities, there are
several basic differences in their type systems.

Java types
^^^^^^^^^^

Java has primitive types and classes.

.. code-block:: java

    int i;
    double d;

- No unsigned primitive integer types

.. code-block:: java

    Pixels pixels = new Pixels();

- All classes are derived from root :cpp:class:`Object`
- Objects are by reference only
- Objects and arrays are always allocated with :cpp:class:`new`
- Destruction is non-deterministic
- All passing is by value (primitives and object references)

.. code-block:: java

    Pixels[] array = new Pixels[5];

- Arrays have an intrinsic size.
- Arrays are safe to index out of bounds (an exception is thrown).

C++ types
^^^^^^^^^

C++ has primitive types, structures and classes.

.. code-block:: cpp

    int16_t i1;
    uint32_t i2;
    double d;

- Primitive integer types may be signed or unsigned.
- Integer types are of defined size.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Allocate on the stack, or as a struct or class member:
    Pixels         pixels;

    // Allocate on the heap
    Pixels        *pixelsptr1 = new Pixels();

    // Pointer to existing instance
    const Pixels  *pixelsptr2 = &pixels;

    // Reference to existing instance
    Pixels&        pixelsref(pixels);

- Classes have no common root
- All types may be instances, pointers or references
- Object construction may be on the stack, on the heap using
  :cpp:class:`new` or in place using placement :cpp:class:`new`.
- Pointers and references may refer to :c:type:`const` type
- Pointers may be :c:type:`const`
- References are implicitly :c:type:`const` (similar to :c:type:`final`)
- Destruction is deterministic
- :c:type:`new` **should never be used** in modern C++ code (see below)

.. code-block:: cpp

    Pixels array[5];

- Arrays “decay” to bare pointers
- Arrays are not safe to index out of bounds
- Size information lost at runtime
- **Never use arrays** outside static initializers

Simplified type names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:c:type:`typedef` is used to create an alias for an existing type.

.. code-block:: cpp

    typedef std::vector<std::string> string_list;
    string_list l;
    string_list::const_iterator i = l.begin();
    // NOT std::vector<std::string>::const_iterator

    typedef std::vector<Pixels> plist;
    plist pl(6);
    plist::size_type idx = 2;
    // size_type NOT unsigned int or uint32_t
    pl.at(idx) = ...;

Used in standard container types e.g. :cpp:type:`size_type`,
:cpp:type:`value_type` and in classes and class templates in
Bio-Formats.  Consistency is needed for generic programming—use the
standard type names to enable interoperability with standard
algorithms.

Exception handling
------------------

Java
^^^^

:c:type:`throws` details which exceptions are thrown by a method.
Java exceptions are also “checked”, requiring the caller to catch and
handle all exceptions which might be thrown, aside from
:cpp:class:`RuntimeException` and its subclasses.

C++
^^^

C++ has exception specifications like Java, however they are useless
aside from :c:type:`nothrow`.  This is because if an exception is
thrown which does not match the specification, it will abort the
program with a :cpp:class:`bad_exception` which makes them unusable in
practice.

Exceptions can be thrown at any point with the exception that they
should **never be thrown in a destructor**.  It is not necessary or
typical to check exceptions except where needed.  All code must be
exception-safe given that an exception could be thrown at any point;
the design considerations for exception safety are covered below.

Interfaces
----------

Java supports single-inheritance, plus interfaces.  C++ supports true
multiple-inheritance, which is rather more flexible, at the expense of
being rather more complicated and dangerous.  However, the Java
single-inheritance-plus-interfaces model can be implemented in C++
using a subset of the facilities provided by multiple inheritance.
Rather than being enforced by the language, it is a set of idioms.
These must be rigorously followed or else things will fail horribly!

C++ interfaces are classes with:

- No instance variables
- Pure virtual methods
- :cpp:type:`protected` default constructor
- :c:type:`public virtual` destructor
- Deleted copy constructor and assignment operator

C++ classes implementing interfaces:

- Use :cpp:type:`public` inheritance for parent class
- Use :c:type:`virtual public` inheritance for implemented interfaces
- Have a :cpp:type:`virtual` destructor

When compiled with optimization enabled, the interface classes should
have zero storage overhead.  If implementing classes do not use
:c:type:`virtual public` inheritance, compilation will fail as soon as
a second class in the inheritance hierarchy also implements the
interface.

Reference handling and memory management
----------------------------------------

Pointer problems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plain (or “dumb”) C++ pointers can be dangerous if used incorrectly.
The Bio-Formats API make a point of never using them unless absolutely
necessary.  For automatic objects allocated on the stack, allocation
and deallocation is automatic and safe:

.. code-block:: cpp

    {
      Image i(filename);
      i.read_plane();

      // Object destroyed when i goes out of scope
    }

In this case, the object's destructor was run and the memory freed
automatically.

Looking at the case where a pointer is used to reference
manually-allocated memory on the heap:

.. code-block:: cpp

    {
      Image *i = new Image(filename);

      i->read_plane();

      // Memory not freed when pointer i goes out of scope
    }

In this case :c:type:`new` was not paired with the corresponding
:c:type:`delete`, resulting in a *memory leak*.  This is the code with
the “leak” fixed:

.. code-block:: cpp

    {
    Image *i = new Image(filename);

    i->read_plane(); // throws exception; memory leaked

    delete i; // never called
  }

:c:type:`new` and :c:type:`delete` are now paired, but the code is not
exception-safe.  If an exception is thrown, memory will still be
leaked.  Manual memory management requires correct clean up for every
exit point in the function, including both all :c:type:`return`
statements and thrown exceptions.  Here, we handle this correctly:

.. code-block:: cpp

    {
      Image *i = new Image(filename);

      try {
        i->read_plane(); // throws exception
      } catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {
        delete i; // clean up
        throw; // rethrow
      }

      delete i; // never called for exceptions
    }

However, this does not scale.  This is painful and error prone when
scaled to an entire codebase.  Even within this simple function, there
is only a single variable with a single exception and single return to
deal with.  Imagine the combinatorial explosion when there are several
variables with different lifetimes and scopes, multiple return points
and several exceptions to handle--this is easy to get wrong, so a more
robust approach is needed.

Use of :cpp:class:`new` is not in the general case safe or sensible.
The Bio-Formats API **never** passes pointers allocated with
:cpp:class:`new`, nor requires any manual memory management.  Instead,
“smart” pointers are used throughout to manage memory safely and
automatically.

:cpp:class:`ome::compat::shared_ptr` as a “smart” pointer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The unsafe example above, has been rewritten to use
:cpp:class:`ome::compat::shared_ptr`:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Start of block
    {
      ome::compat::shared_ptr<Image> i(ome::compat::make_shared<Image>(filename));

      i->read_plane(); // throws exception

      // Memory freed when i's destructor is
      // run at exit of block scope
    }

Rather than managing the memory by hand, responsibility for this is
delegated to a “smart” pointer, :cpp:class:`ome::compat::shared_ptr`.
The memory is freed by the :cpp:class:`ome::compat::shared_ptr`
destructor which is run at the end of the block scope, on explicit
:c:type:`return`, or when cleaned up by exception stack unwinding.

.. note::

    :cpp:class:`ome::compat::shared_ptr` is either a
    :cpp:class:`std::shared_ptr` or a :cpp:class:`boost::shared_ptr`,
    depending upon whether C++11 features are avaiable or not,
    respectively.

- :cpp:class:`shared_ptr` object lifetime manages the resource
- :cpp:class:`new` replaced with :cpp:class:`ome::compat::make_shared`
- May be used as class members; lifetime is tied to class instance
- Clean up for all exit points is automatic and safe
- Allows ownership transfer and sharing
- Allows reference without ownership using :cpp:class:`weak_ptr`
- :cpp:class:`weak_ptr` references the object but does not prevent it
  being freed when the last :cpp:class:`shared_ptr` reference is lost;
  this is useful for cycle breaking and is used by the OME XML model
  objects for references

Resource Acquisition Is Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) is a programming idiom
used throughout modern C++ libraries and applications, including the
Standard Library,

- A class is a proxy for a resource
- The resource is acquired when object is initialised
- The resource is released when object is destroyed
- Any resource may be managed (e.g. memory, files, locks, mutexes)
- The C++ language and runtime guarantees make resource management
  deterministic and reliable
- Safe for use in any scope
- Exception safe
- Used throughout modern C++ libraries and applications

Because this relies implicitly upon the deterministic object
destruction guarantees made by the C++ language, this is not used
widely in Java APIs which often require manual management of resources
such as open files.  Used carefully, RAII will prevent resource leaks
and result in robust, safe code.

The :cpp:class:`FormatReader` API is currently not using RAII due to
the use of the :cpp:func:`FormatHandler::setId()` interface.

C++ reference variants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

    //              Non-constant                                 Constant
    // -------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------
    // Pointer
                                   Image *i;                                 const Image *i;
                            Image * const i;                          const Image * const i;

    // Reference
                                   Image& i;                                 const Image& i;

    // Shared pointer
           ome::compat::shared_ptr<Image> i;         ome::compat::shared_ptr<const Image> i;
     const ome::compat::shared_ptr<Image> i;   const ome::compat::shared_ptr<const Image> i;

    // Shared pointer reference
          ome::compat::shared_ptr<Image>& i;        ome::compat::shared_ptr<const Image>& i;
    const ome::compat::shared_ptr<Image>& i;  const ome::compat::shared_ptr<const Image>& i;

    // Weak pointer
             ome::compat::weak_ptr<Image> i;           ome::compat::weak_ptr<const Image> i;
       const ome::compat::weak_ptr<Image> i;     const ome::compat::weak_ptr<const Image> i;

   // Weak pointer reference
            ome::compat::weak_ptr<Image>& i;          ome::compat::weak_ptr<const Image>& i;
      const ome::compat::weak_ptr<Image>& i;    const ome::compat::weak_ptr<const Image>& i;

Java has one reference type.  Here, we have **22**.  Clearly, not all
of these will typically be used.  Below, a subset of these are shown
for use for particular purposes.

Class member types:

.. code-block:: cpp

  Image i;                             // Concrete instance
  ome::compat::shared_ptr<Image> i;    // Reference
  ome::compat::weak_ptr<Image> i;      // Weak reference

Wherever possible, a concrete instance should be preferred.  This is
not possible for polymorphic types, where a reference is required.  In
this situation, an :cpp:class:`ome::compat::shared_ptr` is preferred
if the class owns the member and/or needs control over its lifetime.
If the class does not have ownership then an
:cpp:class:`ome::compat::weak_ptr` will allow safe access to the
object if it still exists.  In circumstances where manual lifetime
management is required, e.g. for performance, and the member is
guaranteed to exist for the duration of the object's lifetime, a plain
pointer or reference may be used.  A pointer will be used if it is
possible for it to be :cpp:class:`null`, or it may be reassigned more
than once, or if is assigned after initial construction.  If properly
using RAII, using references should be possible and preferred over
bare pointers in all cases.

Argument types:

.. code-block:: cpp

  // Ownership retained
  void read_plane(const Image& image);
  // Ownership shared or transferred
  void read_plane(const ome::compat::shared_ptr<Image>& image);

Passing primitive types by value is acceptable.  However, passing a
struct or class by value will implicitly copy the object into the
callee's stack frame, which may be expensive (and requires a copy
constructor which will not be guaranteed or even possible for
polymorphic types).  Passing by reference avoids the need for any
copying, and passing by :c:type:`const` reference will prevent the
callee from modifying the object, also making it clear that there is
no transfer of ownership.  Passing using an
:cpp:class:`ome::compat::shared_ptr` is possible but not
recommended---the copy will involve reference counting overhead which
can kill multi-threaded performance since it requires synchronization
between all threads; use a :c:type:`const` reference to an
:cpp:class:`ome::compat::shared_ptr` to avoid the overhead.  If
ownership should be transferred or shared with the callee, use a
non-:c:type:`const` reference.

To be absolutely clear, plain pointers are never used and are not
acceptable for ownership transfer.  A plain reference also makes it
clear there is no ownership transfer.

Return types:

.. code-block:: cpp

                            Image get_image(); // Ownership transferred
                           Image& get_image(); // Ownership retained
   ome::compat::shared_ptr<Image> get_image(); // Ownership shared/trans
  ome::compat::shared_ptr<Image>& get_image(); // Ownership shared

If the callee does not retain a copy of the original object, it can't
pass by reference since it can't guarantee the object remaining in
scope after it returns, hence it must create a temporary value and
pass by value.  If the callee does retain a copy, it has the option of
passing by reference.  Passing by reference is preferred when
possible.  Passing by value implies ownership transfer.  Passing by
reference implies ownership retention.  Passing an
:cpp:class:`ome::compat::shared_ptr` by value or reference implies
sharing ownership since the caller can retain a reference; if passing
by value ownership *may* be transferred since this implies the callee
is not retaining a reference to it (but this is not guaranteed).

Again, to be absolutely clear, plain pointers are never used and are
not acceptable for ownership transfer.  A plain reference also makes
it clear there is no ownership transfer.

- Safety: References cannot be :cpp:class:`null`
- Storing polymorphic types requires use of a
  :cpp:class:`shared_ptr`
- Referencing polymorphic types *may* require use of a
  :cpp:class:`shared_ptr`
- Safety: To avoid cyclic dependencies, use :cpp:class:`weak_ptr`
- Safety: To allow object destruction while maintaining a safe
  reference, use :cpp:class:`weak_ptr`
- :cpp:class:`weak_ptr` is not directly usable
- :cpp:class:`weak_ptr` is convertible back to :cpp:class:`shared_ptr`
  for use *if the object is still in existence*
- C++11 *move semantics* (``&&``) improve the performance of ownership
  transfer

Containers
----------

Safe array passing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C++ arrays are not safe to pass in or out of functions since the size
is not known unless passed separately.

.. code-block:: cpp

  class Image
  {
    // Unsafe; size unknown
    uint8_t[] getLUT();
         void setLUT(uint8_t[]& lut);
  };

C++ arrays “decay” to “bare” pointers, and pointers have no associated
size information.

:cpp:class:`ome::compat::array` is a safe alternative.  This is either
a C++11 :cpp:class:`std::array` or :cpp:class:`boost::array` with
older compilers.

.. code-block:: cpp

  class Image
  {
    typedef ome::compat::array<uint8_t, 256> LUT;

    // Safe; size defined
    const LUT& getLUT() const;
          void setLUT(const LUT&);
  };

:cpp:class:`ome::compat::array` is a array-like object (a class which
behaves like an array).  Its type and size are defined in the
template, and it may be passed around like any other object.  Its
:cpp:func:`array::at()` method provides strict bounds checking, while
its index :cpp:func:`array::operator[]` provides unchecked access.

Storing and passing unrelated types
-----------------------------------

Types with a common base
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::vector<ome::compat::shared_ptr<Base> > v;
    v.push_back(ome::compat::make_shared<Derived>());

This can store any type derived from :cpp:class:`Base`.  An
:cpp:class:`ome::compat::shared_ptr` is **essential**.  Without it,
bare pointers to the base would be stored, and memory would be leaked
when elements are removed from the container (unless externally
managed [generally unsafe]).  The same applies to passing polymorphic
types.

Java containers can be problematic:

- Java can store root :cpp:class:`Object` in containers
- Java can pass and return root :cpp:class:`Object` in methods.
- This is not possible in C++: there is no root object.
- An alternative approach is needed.

Arbitrary types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:cpp:class:`boost::any` may be used to store any type:

.. code-block:: cpp

  std::vector<boost::any> v;
  v.push_back(Anything);

- Assign and store any type
- Type erasure (similar to Java generics)
- Use for containers of arbitrary types
- Flexible, but need to cast to each type used to extract
- Code will not be able to handle all possible types meaningfully

This is the most flexible solution, but in order to get a value back
out, requires casting it to its specific type.  This can mean a
situation could arise where values are stored of types which cannot be
handled since it is not possible to write the code to handle every
single possibility ahead of time.  However, if the open-ended
flexibility is needed, this is available.

A fixed set of types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:cpp:class:`boost::variant` may be used to store a limited set of
different types: This avoids the :cpp:class:`boost::any` problem of
not being able to handle all possible types, since the scope is
limited to a set of allowed types, and a :cpp:type:`static_visitor`
can ensure that all types are supported by the code at compile time.

.. code-block:: cpp

  typedef boost::variant<int, std::string> variants;
  std::vector<variants> v;
  v.push_back(43);
  v.push_back("ATTO 647N");

- Store a set of discriminated types
- “External polymorphism” via :cpp:type:`static_visitor`
- Used to store original metadata
- Used to store nD pixel data of different pixel types

This is not an alternative to a common root object.  Instead, this is
a discriminated union, which can store one of a defined set of
“variant” types.  A static visitor pattern may be used to generate
code to operate on all of the supported types.  The variant type may
be used as a class member, passed by value, passed by reference or
stored in a container like any other type.  Due to the way it is
implemented to store values, it does not necessarily need wrapping in
an :cpp:class:`ome::compat::shared_ptr` since it can behave as a value
type (depending upon the context).


Java uses polymorphism to store and pass the root :cpp:class:`Object`
around.  The :cpp:class:`boost::variant` and :cpp:class:`boost::any`
approaches use templates to (internally) create a common base and
manage the stored objects.  However, the end user does not need to
deal with this complexity directly—the use of the types is quite
transparent.

Variant example: MetadataMap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example demonstrates the use of variants with a simple expansion
for two different categories of type (scalars and vectors of scalars).

The :cpp:class:`MetadataMap` class stores key-value pairs, where the
value can be either a string, Boolean, or several integer and floating
point types, or vectors of any of these types.  When converting the
data to other forms, it is necessary to flatten the vector types to a
set of separate key-value pairs with the key having a numbered suffix,
one for each element in the vector.

.. code-block:: cpp

    {
      MetadataMap map;
      MetadataMap flat_map (map.flatten());
    }

A flattened map is created using the following method:

.. code-block:: cpp

    MetadataMap MetadataMap::flatten() const {
      MetadataMap newmap;

      for (MetadataMap::const_iterator i = oldmap.begin();
           i != oldmap.end(); ++i) {
        MetadataMapFlattenVisitor v(newmap, i->first);
        boost::apply_visitor(v, i->second);
      }

      return newmap;
    }

The :cpp:class:`MetadataMapFlattenVisitor` is implemented thusly:

.. code-block:: cpp

    // Flatten MetadataMap vector values
    struct MetadataMapFlattenVisitor : public boost::static_visitor<> {
      MetadataMap& map; // Map of flattened elements
      const MetadataMap::key_type& key; // Current key

      MetadataMapFlattenVisitor
        (MetadataMap&                 map,
         const MetadataMap::key_type& key):
        map(map), key(key) {}

      // Output a scalar value of arbitrary type.
      template <typename T>
      void operator() (const T& v) const {
        map.set(key, v);
      }

      // Output a vector value of arbitrary type.
      template <typename T>
      void operator() (const std::vector<T>& c) const {
        typename std::vector<T>::size_type idx = 1;
        for (typename std::vector<T>::const_iterator i = c.begin();
             i != c.end(); ++i, ++idx) {
          std::ostringstream os;
          os << key << " #" << idx;
          map.set(os.str(), *i);
        }
      }
    };

The :cpp:class:`MetadataMapFlattenVisitor` is derived from
:cpp:class:`boost::static_visitor`, and its templated operator method
is specialized and expanded once for each type supported by the
variant type used by the map.  In the above example, two separate
overloaded operators are provided, one for scalar values which is a
simple copy, and one for vector values which splits the elements into
separate keys in the new map.  The important part is the call to
:cpp:func:`apply_visitor`, which takes as arguments the visitor object
and the variant to apply it to.

This could be done with a large set of conditionals using
``boost::get<T>(value)`` for each supported type.  The benefit of the
:cpp:class:`boost::static_visitor` approach is that it ensures that
all the types are supported *at compile time*, and in effect results
in the same code.  If any types are not supported, the code will fail
to compile.

Variant example: VariantPixelBuffer equality comparison
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example demonstrates the use of variants with a combinatorial
expansion of types.

The :cpp:class:`VariantPixelBuffer` class can contain
:cpp:class:`PixelBuffer` classes of various pixel types.  Comparing
for equality is only performed if the pixel types of the two objects
are the same:

.. code-block:: cpp

    {
      VariantPixelBuffer a, b;
      if (a == b) {
        // Buffers are the same.
      }
    }

This is implemented using an overloaded equality operator:

.. code-block:: cpp

    bool VariantPixelBuffer::operator ==
        (const VariantPixelBuffer& rhs) const
    {
      return boost::apply_visitor(PBCompareVisitor(),
                                  buffer, rhs.buffer);
    }

As before, this is implemented in terms of a
:cpp:class:`boost::static_visitor`, but note that this time it is
specialized for :cpp:type:`bool`, meaning that the return type of
:cpp:func:`apply_visitor` will also be :cpp:type:`bool`, and the
operator methods must also return this type.

.. code-block:: cpp

    struct PBCompareVisitor : public boost::static_visitor<bool> {
      template <typename T, typename U>
      bool operator() (const T& /* lhs */,
                       const U& /* rhs */) const {
        return false;
      }

      template <typename T>
      bool operator() (const T& lhs,
                       const T& rhs) const {
        return lhs && rhs && (*lhs == *rhs);
      }
    };

Unlike the last example, the operator methods now have two arguments,
both of which are variant types, and the :cpp:func:`apply_visitor`
call is passed two variant objects in addition to the visitor object.
This causes the templates to be expanded for all pairwise combinations
of the possible types.  When the types are not equal, the first
templated operator is called, which always returns false.  When the
types are equal the second operator is called; this checks both
operands are not null and then performs an equality comparison using
the buffer contents.  Given that all the operators are inline, we
would hope that a good compiler would cause all the false cases to be
optimized out after expansion.

Variant example: VariantPixelBuffer SFINAE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example demonstrates the use of variants with SFINAE.

C++ has a concept known as Substitution Failure Is Not An Error
(SFINAE), which refers to it not being an error for a candidate
template to fail argument substitution during overload resolution.
While this is in and of itself a fairly obscure language detail, it
enables overloading of a method not just on type, but different
categories of type, for example integer and floating point types,
signed and unsigned integer types, simple and complex types, or
combinations of all of these.  This is particularly useful when
writing algorithms to process pixel data.

Use of SFINAE has been made accessible through the creation of
:cpp:class:`boost::enable_if` (:cpp:class:`std::enable_if` in C++11),
and *type traits* (type category checking classes such as
:cpp:class:`is_integer`).  The following code is an example of how one
might write a visitor for adapting an algorithm to separate
integer, floating point, complex floating point and bitmask cases.

.. code-block:: cpp

    struct TypeCategoryVisitor : public boost::static_visitor<>
    {
      typedef ::ome::bioformats::PixelProperties< ::ome::xml::model::enums::PixelType::BIT>::std_type bit_type;

      TypeCategoryVisitor()
      {}

      // Integer pixel types
      template <typename T>
      typename boost::enable_if_c<
        boost::is_integral<T>::value, void
        >::type
      operator() (ome::compat::shared_ptr< ::ome::bioformats::PixelBuffer<T> >& buf)
      {
        // Integer algorithm.
      }

      // Floating point pixel types
      template <typename T>
      typename boost::enable_if_c<
        boost::is_floating_point<T>::value, void
        >::type
      operator() (ome::compat::shared_ptr< ::ome::bioformats::PixelBuffer<T> >& buf)
      {
        // Floating point algorithm.
      }

      // Complex floating point pixel types
      template <typename T>
      typename boost::enable_if_c<
        boost::is_complex<T>::value, void
        >::type
      operator() (ome::compat::shared_ptr< ::ome::bioformats::PixelBuffer<T> >& buf)
      {
        // Complex floating point algorithm.
      }

      // BIT/bool pixel type.  Note this is a simple overload since it is
      // a simple type, not a category of different types.
      void
      operator() (ome::compat::shared_ptr< ::ome::bioformats::PixelBuffer<bit_type> >& buf)
      {
        // Boolean algorithm.
      }
    };

This visitor may be used with :cpp:func:`apply_visitor` in a similar
manner to the previously demonstrated visitors.

:cpp:class:`enable_if` has two parameters, the first being a
conditional, the second being the return type (in this example, all
the methods return :cpp:type:`void`).  If the conditional is true,
then the type expands to the return type and the template is
successfully substituted.  If the conditional is false (types do not
match), then the substitution fails and the template will not be used.
Note that the conditional is itself a type, which can be confusing,
since all this logic is driven by conditional template expansion.

Normal templates are specialized for a type.  This approach allows
specialization for different *categories* of type.  Without this
approach it would be necessary to write separate overloads for each
individual type (each integer type, each floating point type, each
complex type, etc.), even when the logic would be identical for
e.g. the different integer types.  This approach therefore removes the
need for unnecessary code duplication, and the type traits checks make
each type category explicit to the reader.
