Using Bio-Formats as a Java library
===================================

Bio-Formats as a Maven dependency
---------------------------------

If you wish to make use of Bio-Formats within your own software it can be 
included as a dependency in any Maven project. The dependency can be added 
to the project pom file and should include the desired Bio-Formats version. 
Using `bioformats_package` as the artifactId will include the complete 
Bio-Formats package, or individual components can be chosen as desired.

::

  <dependency>
    <groupId>ome</groupId>
    <artifactId>bioformats_package</artifactId>
    <version>5.2.0</version>
  </dependency>

In order to include this Bio-Formats dependency a custom repository 
must also be added to the project pom or :file:`${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml`.
The repositories element is inherited so for a group of projects the 
repositories element can be defined at the top of your inheritance chain. 

::

  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>ome</id>
      <name>Bio-Formats Repo</name>
      <url>http://artifacts.openmicroscopy.org/artifactory/maven</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
  

Bio-Formats as a Java library
-----------------------------

Alternatively Bio-Formats can be used by including its component jar files. You can
:downloads:`download formats-gpl.jar <artifacts/formats-gpl.jar>` to use it as
a library. Just add **formats-gpl.jar** to your CLASSPATH or build path. You
will also need **common.jar** for common I/O functions, **ome-xml.jar** for
metadata standardization, and `SLF4J <http://slf4j.org/>`_ for :doc:`logging`.

There are also certain packages that if present will be utilized to
provide additional functionality. To include one, just place it in the
same folder.

File writing:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:source:`MinimumWriter <components/formats-gpl/utils/MinimumWriter.java>` -
A command line utility demonstrating the minimum amount of metadata needed to
write a file.

:source:`TiledExport <components/formats-gpl/utils/TiledExportExample.java>` -
Shows how to convert a file one tile at a time, instead of one plane at a time (needed for very large images).

File compression:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:source:`makeLZW <components/formats-gpl/utils/MakeLZW.java>` -
Converts the given image file to an LZW-compressed TIFF.

Metadata extract/print:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:source:`GetPhysicalMetadata <components/formats-gpl/utils/GetPhysicalMetadata.java>` -
Uses Bio-Formats to extract some basic standardized (format-independent) metadata.

:source:`ImageInfo <components/bio-formats-tools/src/loci/formats/tools/ImageInfo.java>` -
A more involved command line utility for thoroughly reading an input file,
printing some information about it, and displaying the pixels
onscreen using the Bio-Formats viewer.

:source:`PrintTimestamps <components/formats-gpl/utils/PrintTimestamps.java>` -
A command line example demonstrating how to extract timestamps from a file.

:source:`PrintLensNA <components/formats-gpl/utils/PrintLensNA.java>` -
Uses Bio-Formats to extract lens numerical aperture in a format-independent manner from a dataset.

:source:`PrintROIs <components/formats-gpl/utils/PrintROIs.java>` -
A simple example of how to retrieve ROI data parsed from a file.

A Note on Java Web Start (bioformats\_package.jar vs. formats-gpl.jar)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To use Bio-Formats with your Java Web Start application, we recommend
using **formats-gpl.jar** rather than **bioformats\_package.jar**—the latter
is merely a bundle of **formats-gpl.jar** plus all its optional
dependencies.

The **bioformats\_package.jar** bundle is intended as a convenience (e.g. to
simplify installation as an ImageJ plugin), but is by no means the only
solution for developers. We recommend using **formats-gpl.jar** as a
separate entity depending on your needs as a developer.

The bundle is quite large because we have added support for several
formats that need large helper libraries (e.g. Imaris' HDF-based
format). However, these additional libraries are optional; Bio-Formats
has been coded using reflection so that it can both compile and run
without them.

When deploying a JNLP-based application, using **bioformats\_package.jar**
directly is not the best approach, since every time Bio-Formats is
updated, the server would need to feed another 15+ MB JAR file to the
client. Rather, Web Start is a case where you should keep the JARs
separate, since JNLP was designed to make management of JAR dependencies
trivial for the end user. By keeping **formats-gpl.jar** and the
optional dependencies separate, only a <1 MB JAR needs to be updated
when **formats-gpl.jar** changes.

As a developer, you have the option of packaging **formats-gpl.jar**
with as many or as few optional libraries as you wish, to cut down on
file size as needed. You are free to make whatever kind of "stripped
down" version you require. You could even build a custom
**formats-gpl.jar** that excludes certain classes, if you like.

For an explicit enumeration of all the optional libraries included in
**bioformats\_package.jar**, see the ``package.libraries`` variable of the
:source:`ant/toplevel.properties <ant/toplevel.properties>`
file of the distribution. You can also read our notes about each in the
source distribution's Ant :source:`build.xml <build.xml#L240>` script.
