Using Bio-Formats as a Java library
===================================

If you wish to make use of Bio-Formats within your own software, you can
:bf_plone:`download bio-formats.jar <downloads>` to use it as a library. Just 
add **bio-formats.jar** to your CLASSPATH or build path. You will also need 
**loci-common.jar** for common I/O functions, **ome-xml.jar** for metadata 
standardization, and `SLF4J <http://slf4j.org/>`_ for logging. 

Beyond **bio-formats.jar**, **loci-common.jar**, **ome-xml.jar**, and
`SLF4J <http://slf4j.org/>`_, no additional libraries are required.
However, there are certain packages that if present will be utilized to
provide additional functionality. To include one, just place it in the
same folder.

for a complete and up-to-date list of all optional libraries, which can
all be found in our :source:`Git repository <jar>`.

Examples of usage
-----------------

:source:`ImageConverter <components/scifio/src/loci/formats/tools/ImageConverter.java>` - 
A simple command line tool for converting between formats.

:source:`ImageInfo <components/scifio/src/loci/formats/tools/ImageInfo.java>` - 
A more involved command line utility for thoroughly reading an input file, 
printing some information about it, and displaying the pixels
onscreen using the Bio-Formats viewer.

:source:`MinimumWriter <components/bio-formats/utils/MinimumWriter.java>` - 
A command line utility demonstrating the minimum amount of metadata needed to 
write a file.

:source:`PrintTimestamps <components/bio-formats/utils/PrintTimestamps.java>` - 
A command line example demonstrating how to extract timestamps from a file.

:source:`Simple_Read <components/loci-plugins/utils/Simple_Read.java>` - 
A simple ImageJ plugin demonstrating how to use Bio-Formats to read files into 
ImageJ (see :doc:`/users/imagej/index`).

:source:`Read_Image <components/loci-plugins/utils/Read_Image.java>` - 
An ImageJ plugin that uses Bio-Formats to build up an image stack, reading 
image planes one by one (see :doc:`/users/imagej/index`).

:source:`Mass_Importer <components/loci-plugins/utils/Mass_Importer.java>` - 
A simple plugin for ImageJ that demonstrates how to open all image files in a 
directory using Bio-Formats, grouping files with similar names to avoiding 
opening the same dataset more than once (see :doc:`/users/imagej/index`).


A Note on Java Web Start (loci\_tools.jar vs. bio-formats.jar)
--------------------------------------------------------------

To use Bio-Formats with your Java Web Start application, we recommend
using **bio-formats.jar** rather than **loci\_tools.jar**—the latter is
merely a bundle of **bio-formats.jar** plus all its optional
dependencies.

The **loci\_tools.jar** bundle is intended as a convenience (e.g. to
simplify installation as an ImageJ plugin), but is by no means the only
solution for developers. We recommend using **bio-formats.jar** as a
separate entity depending on your needs as a developer.

The bundle is quite large because we have added support for several
formats that need large helper libraries (e.g. Imaris's HDF-based
format). However, these additional libraries are optional; Bio-Formats
has been coded using reflection so that it can both compile and run
without them.

When deploying a JNLP-based application, using **loci\_tools.jar**
directly is not the best approach, since every time Bio-Formats is
updated, the server would need to feed another 8+ MB JAR file to the
client. Rather, Web Start is a case where you should keep the JARs
separate, since JNLP was designed to make management of JAR dependencies
trivial for the end user. By keeping **bio-formats.jar** and the
optional dependencies separate, only a <1 MB JAR needs to be updated
when **bio-formats.jar** changes.

As a developer, you have the option of packaging **bio-formats.jar**
with as many or as few optional libraries as you wish, to cut down on
file size as needed. You are free to make whatever kind of "stripped
down" version you require. You could even build a custom
**bio-formats.jar** that excludes certain classes, if you like.

For an explicit enumeration of all the optional libraries included in
**loci\_tools.jar**, see the ``loci-tools.libraries`` variable of the
:source:`ant/toplevel.properties <ant/toplevel.properties>`
file of the distribution. You can also read our notes about each in the
source distribution's Ant :source:`build.xml <build.xml#L240>` script.
