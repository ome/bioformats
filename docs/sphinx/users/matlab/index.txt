MATLAB
======

`MATLAB <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>`_ is a high-level
language and interactive environment that facilitates rapid development
of algorithms for performing computationally intensive tasks.

Calling Bio-Formats from MATLAB is fairly straightforward, since MATLAB
has built-in interoperability with Java. We have created a
`set of scripts <https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/tree/develop/components/bio-formats/matlab>`
for reading image files.

.. |bfopen| replace:: :source:`bfopen.m <components/bio-formats/matlab/bfopen.m>`

Installation
------------

Download the `M files <https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/tree/develop/components/bio-formats/matlab>` and :bf_plone:`loci_tools.jar <downloads>` and place them in your MATLAB work directory.

Usage
-----

Please see the `Bio-Formats MATLAB Guide </developers/matlab-dev>` for usage
instructions.  If you intend to extend the existing .m files, please also see
the `developer page </developers>` for more information on how to use
Bio-Formats in general.

Performance
-----------

In our tests (MATLAB R14 vs. java 1.6.0\_20), the script executes at
approximately half the speed of our
:doc:`showinf command line tool </users/comlinetools/index>`, due to
overhead from copying arrays.

Upgrading
---------

To use a newer version of Bio-Formats, overwrite **loci_tools.jar**
with the :bf_plone:`newer version <downloads>` and restart MATLAB.

Alternative scripts
-------------------

Several other groups have developed their own MATLAB scripts that use
Bio-Formats, including the following:

    - `<https://github.com/prakatmac/bf-tools/>`
    - `<http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32920-imread-for-multiple-life-science-image-file-formats>`
