MATLAB
======

`MATLAB <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>`_ is a high-level
language and interactive environment that facilitates rapid development
of algorithms for performing computationally intensive tasks.

Calling Bio-Formats from MATLAB is fairly straightforward, since MATLAB
has built-in interoperability with Java. We have created a :source:`set
of scripts <components/bio-formats/matlab>` for reading image files.

Installation
------------

Download the :source:`M files <components/bio-formats/matlab>` and
:bf_plone:`loci_tools.jar <downloads>` and place them in your MATLAB
work directory.

Usage
-----

Please see the :doc:`Bio-Formats MATLAB Guide </developers/matlab-dev>`
for usage instructions. If you intend to extend the existing .m files,
please also see the :doc:`developer page </developers/index>` for more
information on how to use Bio-Formats in general.

Performance
-----------

In our tests (MATLAB R14 vs. java 1.6.0\_20), the script executes at
approximately half the speed of our
:doc:`showinf command line tool </users/comlinetools/index>`, due to
overhead from copying arrays.

Upgrading
---------

To use a newer version of Bio-Formats, overwrite **loci_tools.jar**
with the :bf_plone:`newer version <downloads>` and restart MATLAB.

Alternative scripts
-------------------

Several other groups have developed their own MATLAB scripts that use
Bio-Formats, including the following:

- `<https://github.com/prakatmac/bf-tools/>`_
- `<http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/32920-imread-for-multiple-life-science-image-file-formats>`_
