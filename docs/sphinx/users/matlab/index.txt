MATLAB
======

`MATLAB <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>`_ is a high-level
language and interactive environment that facilitates rapid development
of algorithms for performing computationally intensive tasks.

Calling Bio-Formats from MATLAB is fairly straightforward, since MATLAB
has built-in interoperability with Java. We have created a simple script
for reading image files: |bfopen|.

We are not MATLAB expertsâ€”any comments on improving the script are
welcome.

.. |bfopen| replace:: :source:`bfopen.m <components/bio-formats/matlab/bfopen.m>`

Performance
-----------

In our tests (MATLAB R14 vs. java 1.6.0\_20), the script executes at
approximately half the speed of our
:doc:`showinf command line tool </users/comlinetools/index>`, due to
overhead from copying arrays.

Installation
------------

To use the script, download |bfopen| and :bf_plone:`loci_tools.jar <downloads>` and place them in your MATLAB work directory.

Upgrading
---------

To use a newer version of Bio-Formats, overwrite **loci_tools.jar**
with the :bf_plone:`newer version <downloads>` and restart MATLAB.
