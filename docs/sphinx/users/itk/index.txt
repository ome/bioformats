ITK
===

The `Insight Toolkit <http://itk.org/>`_ (ITK) is an open-source,
cross-platform system that provides developers with an extensive suite
of software tools for image analysis. Developed through extreme
programming methodologies, ITK employs leading-edge algorithms for
registering and segmenting multidimensional data.

ITK provides an ImageIO plug-in structure that works via discovery through
a dependency injection scheme. This allows a program built on ITK to
load plug-ins for reading and writing different image types without
actually linking to the ImageIO libraries required for those types. Such
encapsulation automatically grants two major boons: firstly, programs
can be easily extended just by virtue of using ITK (developers do not
have to specifically accommodate or anticipate what plug-ins may be
used). Secondly, the architecture provides a distribution method for
open source software, like Bio-Formats, which have licenses that might
otherwise exclude them from being used with other software suites.

The `SCIFIO ImageIO <https://github.com/scifio/scifio-imageio>`_ plugin
provides an for ITK imageIO base that uses
`Bio-Formats <http://farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/Bio-Formats>`_ to read and
write supported life sciences file formats. This plugin allows any program
built on ITK to read any of the image types supported by Bio-Formats.

Prerequisites
-------------

You should have `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_ installed, to allow the
configuration of ITK builds. If you want the latest ITK development build, you
will need `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ as well.

Installation
------------

Simply download ITK from the
`Kitware software page <http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html>`_.
Using CMake, set the following configuration flag::

    Module_SCIFIO = ON

.. note:: This flag is only visible in "advanced" mode within CMake

If you would like to use the utility classes included with the SCIFIO imageIO,
also set the flag::

    BUILD_TESTING = ON

Then build ITK as normal. It will automatically download and build the latest
SCIFIO imageIO plugin.

Usage
-----

Applications using the installed ITK should automatically defer to the SCIFIO
ImageIO, and thus Bio-Formats, when reading or saving images not natively
supported by ITK.

To use the SCIFIO test utility, run::

   SCIFIOTestDriver

from your ``${ITK_BUILD}/bin`` directory. This program has four separate
applications that can be directly invoked using the syntax::

   SCIFIOTestDriver [Program to run] [Program arguments]

The programs are as follows:

.. glossary::

    itkSCIFIOImageInfoTest
        Displays basic information to verify the SCIFIO imageIO works, using
        .fake images.

    itkSCIFIOImageIOTest
        Reads an input image, and writes it out as a specified type

    itkRGBSCIFIOImageTest
        Same as itkSCIFIOImageIOTest but for
        `RGB <http://www.itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1RGBPixel.html>`_
        types

    itkVectorImageSCIFIOImageIOTest
        Same as itkSCIFIOImageIOTest but for
        `VectorImage <http://www.itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1VectorImage.html>`_
        type

For example, to convert a .czi image to a .tif, you would use::

   SCIFIOTestDriver itkSCIFIOImageIOTest in.czi out.tif
