ITK
===

The `Insight Toolkit <http://itk.org/>`_ (ITK) is an open-source,
cross-platform system that provides developers with an extensive suite
of software tools for image analysis. Developed through extreme
programming methodologies, ITK employs leading-edge algorithms for
registering and segmenting multidimensional data.

ITK provides an ImageIO plug-in structure that works via discovery through
a dependency injection scheme. This allows a program built on ITK to
load plug-ins for reading and writing different image types without
actually linking to the ImageIO libraries required for those types. Such
encapsulation automatically grants two major boons: firstly, programs
can be easily extended just by virtue of using ITK (developers do not
have to specifically accommodate or anticipate what plug-ins may be
used). Secondly, the architecture provides a distribution method for
open source software, like Bio-Formats, which have licenses that might
otherwise exclude them from being used with other software suites.

The `SCIFIO ImageIO <https://github.com/scifio/scifio-imageio>`_ plugin provides an for ITK imageIO base that uses `Bio-Formats <http://farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/Bio-Formats>`_ to read and write supported life sciences file formats. This plugin allows any program built on ITK to read any of the image types supported by Bio-Formats.

Prerequisites
-------------

You should have `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`_ installed, to allow the configuration of ITK builds. If you want the latest ITK development build, you will need `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ as well.

Installation
------------

Simply download ITK from the `Kitware software page <http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html>`_. Using CMake, set the following configuration flag:

(NOTE: this flag is only visible in "advanced" mode within CMake)

* Fetch_SCIFIO = ON

If you would like to use the utility classes included with the SCIFIO imageIO, also set the flag:

* BUILD_TESTING = ON

Then build ITK as normal. It will automatically download and build the latest SCIFIO imageIO plugin.
Usage

Applications using the installed ITK should automatically defer to the SCIFIO ImageIO, and thus Bio-Formats, when reading or saving images not natively supported by ITK.

To use the SCIFIO test utility, run::

   ITKIOSCIFIOTestDriver

from your *${ITK_BUILD}/bin* directory. This program has four separate applications that can be directly invoked using the syntax::

   ITKIOSCIFIOTestDriver [Program to run] [Program arguments]

The programs are as follows:

* itkSCIFIOImageInfoTest - Displays basic information to verify the SCIFIO imageIO works, using .fake images.
* itkSCIFIOImageIOTest - Reads an input image, and writes it out as a specified type
* itkRGBSCIFIOImageTest - Same as itkSCIFIOImageIOTest but for `RGB <http://www.itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1RGBPixel.html>`_ types
* itkVectorImageSCIFIOImageIOTest - Same as itkSCIFIOImageIOTest but for `VectorImage <http://www.itk.org/Doxygen/html/classitk_1_1VectorImage.html>`_ type

For example, to convert a .czi image to a .tif, you would use::

   ITKIOSCIFIOTestDriver itkSCIFIOImageIOTest in.czi out.tif
