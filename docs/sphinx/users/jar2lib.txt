Jar2Lib
=======

The Jar2Lib project was designed as a developer tool for converting Java
jar files to C++ libraries.  The wrapping is performed using
`Jace <http://code.google.com/p/jace/>`_, but using the
`Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`_ build system circumvents any need
for the user to download any extra dependencies.

Jar2Lib comes bundled with BFCPP, allowing users to build the C++
version of the Bio-Formats libraries and demonstrating a general file
structure for projects to be wrapped.

The cpp-wrap project, used in
`Wiscscan, <http://dev.loci.wisc.edu/trac/internal/browser/trunk/WiscScan>`_
also provides a practical demonstration for Jar2Lib.  Cpp-wrap takes
advantage of the Maven plug-in infrastructure to grant users the ability
to easy convert a Java library to C++ using Jar2Lib, without requiring
any knowledge of Jar2Lib's workings or syntax.
