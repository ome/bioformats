Endrov
======

`Endrov <https://github.com/mahogny/Endrov>`_ (EV) is a multi-purpose image
analysis program developed by the `Thomas Burglin
group <http://www.bionut.ki.se/groups/tbu/>`_ at `Karolinska
Institute <http://ki.se/start>`_, Department of Biosciences and
Nutrition.

Installation
------------

The EV distribution comes bundled with the core Bio-Formats library
(**bio-formats.jar**), so no further installation is necessary.

Upgrading
---------

It should be possible to use a newer version of Bio-Formats by
downloading the latest
:downloads:`formats-gpl.jar <artifacts/formats-gpl.jar>`
and putting it into the ``libs`` folder of the EV distribution,
overwriting the old file.

You could also include some :doc:`optional
libraries </developers/java-library>`, to add
support for additional formats, if desired.
