VisBio
======

`VisBio <http://loci.wisc.edu/software/visbio>`_ is a biological
visualization tool designed for easy visualization and analysis of
multidimensional image data. VisBio uses Bio-Formats to import
files as the Bio-Formats library originally grew out of our
efforts to continually expand the file format support within VisBio.

Installation
------------

VisBio is bundled with Bio-Formats, so no further installation is
necessary.

Upgrading
---------

It should be possible to use a `newer version of Bio-Formats <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/>`_ 
by overwriting the old **bio-formats.jar** and optional libraries within
the VisBio distribution. For Mac OS X, you'll have to control click the
VisBio program icon, choose "Show Package Contents" and navigate into
Contents/Resources/Java to find the JAR files.
