Converting a file to different format
=====================================

The :command:`bfconvert` :doc:`command line tool <index>` can be used to convert
files between :doc:`supported formats </supported-formats>`.

:command:`bfconvert` with no options displays a summary of available options.

.. program:: bfconvert

To convert a file to single output file (e.g. TIFF):

::

  bfconvert /path/to/input output.tiff

The output file format is determined by the extension of the output file, e.g.
.tiff for TIFF files, .ome.tiff for OME-TIFF, .png for PNG.

.. option:: -series SERIES

    All images in the input file are converted by default.  To convert only one
    series::

      bfconvert -series 0 /path/to/input output-first-series.tiff

.. option:: -timepoint TIMEPOINT

    To convert only one timepoint::

      bfconvert -timepoint 0 /path/to/input output-first-timepoint.tiff

.. option:: -channel CHANNEL

    To convert only one channel::

      bfconvert -channel 0 /path/to/input output-first-channel.tiff

.. option:: -z Z

    To convert only one Z section::

      bfconvert -z 0 /path/to/input output-first-z.tiff

.. option:: -range START END

    To convert images between certain indices (inclusive)::

      bfconvert -range 0 2 /path/to/input output-first-3-images.tiff

.. option:: -tilex TILEX, -tiley TILEY

    All images larger than 4096x4096 will be saved as a set of tiles if the
    output format supports doing so.  The default tile size is determined by
    the input format, and can be overridden like this::

      bfconvert -tilex 512 -tiley 512 /path/to/input output-512x512-tiles.tiff

    :option:`-tilex` is the width in pixels of each tile; :option:`-tiley` is
    the height in pixels of each tile.  The last row and column of tiles may
    be slightly smaller if the image width and height are not multiples of the
    specified tile width and height.  Note that specifying :option:`-tilex`
    and :option:`-tiley` will cause tiles to be written even if the image is
    smaller than 4096x4096.

    Also note that the specified tile size will affect performance.  If large
    amounts of data are being processed, it is a good idea to try converting a
    single tile with a few different tile sizes using the :option:`-crop`
    option. This gives an idea of what the most performant size will be.

Images can also be written to multiple files by specifying a pattern string
in the output file.  For example, to write one series, timepoint, channel, and
Z section per file::

  bfconvert /path/to/input output_series_%s_Z%z_C%c_T%t.tiff

``%s`` is the series index, ``%z`` is the Z section index, ``%c`` is the
channel index, and ``%t`` is the timepoint index (all indices begin at 0).

For large images in particular, it can also be useful to write each tile to
a separate file::

  bfconvert -tilex 512 -tiley 512 /path/to/input output_tile_%x_%y_%m.jpg

``%x`` is the row index of the tile, ``%y`` is the column
index of the tile, and ``%m`` is the overall tile index.  As above, all
indices begin at 0.  Note that if ``%x`` or ``%y`` is included in the file
name pattern, then the other must be included too.  The only exception is if
``%m`` was also included in the pattern.

.. option:: -compression COMPRESSION

    By default, all images will be written uncompressed.  Supported compression
    modes vary based upon the output format, but when multiple modes are
    available the compression can be changed using the :option:`-compression`
    option. For example, to use LZW compression in a TIFF file::

      bfconvert -compression LZW /path/to/input output-lzw.tiff

.. option:: -overwrite

    If the specified output file already exists, :program:`bfconvert` will
    prompt to overwrite the file.  When running :program:`bfconvert`
    non-interactively, it may be useful to always allow :program:`bfconvert` to
    overwrite the output file::

      bfconvert -overwrite /path/to/input /path/to/output

.. option:: -nooverwrite

    To always exit without overwriting::

      bfconvert -nooverwrite /path/to/input /path/to/output

.. option:: -bigtiff

    This option forces the writing of a BigTiff file::

      bfconvert -bigtiff /path/to/input output.ome.tiff

    .. versionadded:: 5.1.2

      The :option:`-bigtiff` option is not necessary if a BigTiff extension is
      used for the output file, e.g.::

        bfconvert /path/to/input output.ome.btf
