Converting a file to different format
=====================================

The :command:`bfconvert` :doc:`command line tool <index>` can be used to convert
files between :doc:`supported formats </supported-formats>`.

:command:`bfconvert` with no options displays a summary of available options.

To convert a file to single output file (e.g. TIFF):

::

  bfconvert /path/to/input output.tiff

The output file format is determined by the extension of the output file, e.g.
.tiff for TIFF files, .ome.tiff for OME-TIFF, .png for PNG.

All images in the input file are converted by default.  To convert only one
series:

::

  bfconvert -series 0 /path/to/input output-first-series.tiff

To convert only one timepoint:

::

  bfconvert -timepoint 0 /path/to/input output-first-timepoint.tiff

To convert only one channel:

::

  bfconvert -channel 0 /path/to/input output-first-channel.tiff

To convert only one Z section:

::

  bfconvert -z 0 /path/to/input output-first-z.tiff

To convert images between certain indices (inclusive):

::

  bfconvert -range 0 2 /path/to/input output-first-3-images.tiff

All images larger than 4096x4096 will be saved as a set of tiles if the output
format supports doing so.  The default tile size is determined by the input
format, and can be overridden like this:

::

  bfconvert -tilex 512 -tiley 512 /path/to/input output-512x512-tiles.tiff

``-tilex`` is the width in pixel of each tile; ``-tiley`` is the height in
pixels of each tile.  The last row and column of tiles may be slightly smaller
if the image width and height are not multiples of the specified tile width
and height.  Note that specifying ``-tilex`` and ``-tiley`` will cause tiles
to be written even if the image is smaller than 4096x4096.

Also note that the specified tile size will affect performance.  If large
amounts of data are being processed, it is a good idea to try converting a
single tile with a few different tile sizes using the ``-crop`` option.
This gives an idea of what the most performant size will be.

Images can also be written to multiple files by specifying a pattern string
in the output file.  For example, to write one series, timepoint, channel, and
Z section per file:

::

  bfconvert /path/to/input output_series_%s_Z%z_C%c_T%t.tiff

``%s`` is the series index, ``%z`` is the Z section index, ``%c`` is the
channel index, and ``%t`` is the timepoint index (all indices begin at 0).

For large images in particular, it can also be useful to write each tile to
a separate file:

::

  bfconvert -tilex 512 -tiley 512 /path/to/input output_tile_%x_%y_%m.jpg

``%x`` is the row index of the tile, ``%y`` is the column
index of the tile, and ``%m`` is the overall tile index.  As above, all
indices begin at 0.  Note that if ``%x`` or ``%y`` is included in the file
name pattern, then the other must be included too.  The only exception is if
``%m`` was also included in the pattern.

By default, all images will be written uncompressed.  Supported compression
modes vary based upon the output format, but when multiple modes are available
the compression can be changed using the ``-compression`` option.  For
example, to use LZW compression in a TIFF file:

::

  bfconvert -compression LZW /path/to/input output-lzw.tiff

If the specified output file already exists, :command:`bfconvert` will prompt to
overwrite the file.  When running :command:`bfconvert` non-interactively, it may be
useful to always allow :command:`bfconvert` to overwrite the output file:

::

  bfconvert -overwrite /path/to/input /path/to/output

or always exit without overwriting:

::

  bfconvert -nooverwrite /path/to/input /path/to/output
