Converting a file to different format
=====================================

The ``bfconvert`` :doc:`command line tool <index>` can be used to convert
files between :doc:`supported formats </supported-formats>`.

``bfconvert`` with no options displays a summary of available options.

To convert a file to single output file (e.g. TIFF):

::

  bfconvert /path/to/input output.tiff

The output file format is determined by the extension of the output file, e.g.
.tiff for TIFF files, .ome.tiff for OME-TIFF, .png for PNG.

All images in the input file are converted by default.  To convert only one
series:

::

  bfconvert -series 0 /path/to/input output-first-series.tiff

To convert only one timepoint:

::

  bfconvert -timepoint 0 /path/to/input output-first-timepoint.tiff

To convert only one channel:

::

  bfconvert -channel 0 /path/to/input output-first-channel.tiff

To convert only one Z section:

::

  bfconvert -z 0 /path/to/input output-first-z.tiff

To convert images between certain indices (inclusive):

::

  bfconvert -range 0 2 /path/to/input output-first-3-images.tiff


Images can also be written to multiple files by specifying a pattern string
in the output file.  For example, to write one series, timepoint, channel, and
Z section per file:

::

  bfconvert /path/to/input output_series_%s_Z%z_C%c_T%t.tiff

``%s`` is the series index, ``%z`` is the Z section index, ``%c`` is the
channel index, and ``%t`` is the timepoint index (all indices begin at 0).

By default, all images will be written uncompressed.  Supported compression
modes vary based upon the output format, but when multiple modes are available
the compression can be changed using the ``-compression`` option.  For
example, to use LZW compression in a TIFF file:

::

  bfconvert -compression LZW /path/to/input output-lzw.tiff
