Displaying images and metadata
==============================

The ``showinf`` :doc:`command line tool <index>` can be used to show the
images and metadata contained in a file.

If no options are specified, ``showinf`` displays a summary of available
options.

To simply display images:

::

  showinf /path/to/file

All of the images in the first 'series' (or 5 dimensional stack) will be
opened and displayed in a simple image viewer.  The number of series, image
dimensions, and other basic metadata will be printed to the console.

To display a different series, for example the second one:

::

  showinf -series 1 /path/to/file

Note that series numbers begin with 0.

To display the OME-XML metadata for a file on the console:

::

  showinf -omexml /path/to/file

Image reading can be suppressed if only the metadata is needed:

::

  showinf -nopix /path/to/file

A subset of images can also be opened instead of the entire stack, by
specifying the start and end plane indices (inclusive):

::

  showinf -range 0 0 /path/to/file

That opens only the first image in first series in the file.

For very large images, it may also be useful to open a small tile from the
image instead of reading everything into memory.  To open the upper-left-most
512x512 tile from the images:

::

  showinf -crop 0,0,512,512 /path/to/file

The parameter to ``-crop`` is of the format ``x,y,width,height``.  The (x, y)
coordinate (0, 0) is the upper-left corner of the image; ``x + width`` must be
less than or equal to the image width and ``y + height`` must be less than or
equal to the image height.

By default, ``showinf`` will check for a new version of Bio-Formats.  This can
take several seconds (especially on a slow internet connection); to save time,
the update check can be disabled:

::

  showinf -no-update /path/to/file

Similarly, if OME-XML is displayed then it will automatically be validated.
On slow or missing internet connections, this can take some time, and so can
be disabled:

::

  showinf -novalid /path/to/file

Most output can be suppressed:

::

  showinf -nocore /path/to/file

and to display the OME-XML alone:

::

  showinf -omexml-only /path/to/file

This is particularly helpful when there are hundreds or thousands of series.

Debugging output can also be enabled if more information is needed:

::

  showinf -debug /path/to/file
