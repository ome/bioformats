Command line tools
==================

There are several scripts for using Bio-Formats on the command
line.

Installation
------------

Download :bf_plone:`bftools.zip <downloads>`, unzip it into a new folder, 
then download :bf_plone:`loci_tools.jar <downloads>` and place it in the 
same folder.

The zip file contains both Unix scripts and Windows batch files.
Currently available tools include:

.. glossary::

    showinf
        Prints information about a given image file to the console, and
        displays the image itself in the Bio-Formats image viewer.

    bfview
        Launches the Bio-Formats image viewer, displaying the given file (if
        any).

    ijview
        Displays the given image file in ImageJ using the Bio-Formats Importer
        plugin (requires **ij.jar**).

    bfconvert
        Converts an image file from one format to another. Bio-Formats must
        support writing to the output file (determined by extension; see the
        :doc:`/supported-formats`).

    formatlist
        Displays a list of supported file formats in HTML, plaintext or XML.

    xmlindent
        A simple XML prettifier similar to ``xmllint --format`` but more
        robust in that it attempts to produce output regardless of syntax
        errors in the XML.

    xmlvalid
        A command-line XML validation tool, useful for checking an OME-XML
        document for compliance with the OME-XML schema.

    omeul
        A command-line client-side import tool for OME.

    tiffcomment
        Dumps the comment from the given TIFF file's first IFD entry; useful
        for examining the OME-XML block in an OME-TIFF file.

All scripts require **loci\_tools.jar** in the same directory as the
command line tools.

Tutorial
--------

There is a `Bio-Formats command line tools
tutorial <http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/FARSIGHT_Tutorials/Bio-Formats>`_
on the FARSIGHT web site.

Using the tools directly from source
------------------------------------

If you have :doc:`checked out the source from the Git
repository </developers/source-code>`
you already have the command line tools in the ``tools`` directory. You
can configure the scripts to use your source tree instead of
**loci\_tools.jar** in the same directory by following these steps:

#. Point your CLASSPATH to the checked-out directory and the JAR files
   in the **jar** folder.

   -  E.g. on Windows with Java 1.6 or later, if you have checked out
      the source at ``C:\code\loci``, set your CLASSPATH environment
      variable to the value ``C:\code\loci\jar\*;C:\code\loci``. You can
      access the environment variable configuration area by
      right-clicking on My Computer, choosing Properties, Advanced tab,
      Environment Variables button.

#. Compile the source with ``ant compile``.
#. Set the ``LOCI_DEVEL`` environment variable to any value (the
   variable just needs to be defined).
