FARSIGHT
========

`FARSIGHT <http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/>`_ is a collection of
modules for image analysis created by LOCI's collaborators at the
`University of Houston <http://www.uh.edu/>`_. These
open source modules are built on the :doc:`/users/itk/index` library
and thus can take advantage of ITK's support for Bio-Formats to process
otherwise unsupported image formats.

The principal FARSIGHT module that benefits from Bio-Formats is the
`Nucleus Editor <http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/NucleusEditor>`_,
though in principle any FARSIGHT-based code that reads image formats via
the standard ITK mechanism will be able to leverage Bio-Formats.
