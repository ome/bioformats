FARSIGHT
========

`FARSIGHT <http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ is a
collection of modules for image analysis created by LOCI's collaborators
at the `Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute <http://www.rpi.edu/>`_. These
open-source modules are built on the :doc:`/users/itk/index` libraries and thus
can take advantage of LOCI's BF-ITK plugin for processing normally unsupported
image types.

The principal FARSIGHT module that benefits from the BF-ITK plugin is
the `Nucleus
Editor <http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/NucleusEditor>`_. The
Nucleus Editor has been shown to work well with BF-ITK on Mac and Linux
operating systems, but unfortunately not on Windows. Note that both
FARSIGHT and BF-ITK can work independently on Windows. 

**Warning**: you will find links for downloading pre-built versions of both
FARSIGHT and the BF-ITK plugin below. However, currently these have not
been shown to work together on any operating system. 

In summary, to use the Bio-Formats plugin with a FARSIGHT module, you will
need to build the FARSIGHT module from source and should be using a Linux or
Mac-based computer.

To use FARSIGHT and BF-ITK together, there are several tutorials that will
guide you through the process of downloading and building the source code for
these projects:

-  `This
   tutorial <http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/FARSIGHT_HowToBuild>`_
   will guide you through building FARSIGHT exclusively. Once FARSIGHT
   is built, you can follow the instructions on the :doc:`/users/itk/index`
   page to download and install a pre-built version of BFTIK.
-  `The tutorials on this
   page <http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/FARSIGHT_Tutorials/Building_Software/Bio-Formats>`_
   provide platform-specific guides for building both FARSIGHT and the
   BF-ITK plugin from source.

If you are just interested in using FARSIGHT without going through the
steps of compiling from source, you can visit `this downloads
page <http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/Special:FarsightDownloads>`_
and download stable releases of FARSIGHT.
