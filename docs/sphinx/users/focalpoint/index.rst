FocalPoint
==========

`FocalPoint <https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/focalpoint/>`_
is an image browser, similar to `Windows
Explorer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Explorer>`_ or other
`file manager <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager>`_ application,
specifically designed to work with more complex image types. FocalPoint
uses Bio-Formats to generate thumbnails for some formats.

Installation
------------

FocalPoint is bundled with Bio-Formats, so no further installation is
necessary.

Upgrading
---------

It should be possible to use a `newer version of Bio-Formats <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/>`_
by overwriting the old **loci\_tools.jar** within the FocalPoint
distribution. For Mac OS X, you will have to control click the FocalPoint
program icon, choose "Show Package Contents" and navigate into
Contents/Resources/Java to find the **loci\_tools.jar** file.
