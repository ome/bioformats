CellProfiler
============

`CellProfiler <http://www.cellprofiler.org/>`_—developed by the `Broad
Institute <http://www.broadinstitute.org/>`_'s `Imaging
Platform <http://www.broadinstitute.org/science/platforms/imaging/imaging-platform>`_—is
free open-source software designed to enable biologists without training
in computer vision or programming to quantitatively measure phenotypes
from thousands of images automatically. CellProfiler uses Bio-Formats to
read images from disk, as well as write movies.

Installation
------------

The CellProfiler distribution comes with Bio-Formats included, so no
further installation is necessary.

Upgrading
---------

It should be possible to use a newer version of Bio-Formats by replacing
the bundled **loci\_tools.jar** with a newer version.

-  For example, on Mac OS X, Ctrl+click the CellProfiler icon, choose
   Show Package Contents, and replace the following files:

   -  Contents/Resources/bioformats/loci\_tools.jar
   -  Contents/Resources/lib/python2.5/bioformats/loci\_tools.jar
