BISQUE
======

The `BISQUE <http://www.bioimage.ucsb.edu/bisque>`_ (Bio-Image Semantic
Query User Environment) Database, developed at the Center for Bio-Image
Informatics at UCSB, was developed for the exchange and exploration of
biological images. The Bisque system supports several areas useful for
imaging researchers from image capture to image analysis and querying.
The bisque system is centered around a database of images and metadata.
Search and comparison of datasets by image data and content is
supported. Novel semantic analyses are integrated into the system
allowing high level semantic queries and comparison of image content.

Bisque integrates with Bio-Formats by calling the
:doc:`showinf command line tool </users/comlinetools/index>`.
