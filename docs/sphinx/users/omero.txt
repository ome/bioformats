OMERO
=====

OMERO is client-server software for microscope image data
management, visualization, and analysis. See the `OMERO
documentation <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4>`_ for
details. The :omerodoc:`OMERO.importer <users/clients-overview.html#omero-importer>`
client uses Bio-Formats to read image pixels and propagate metadata into
the OMERO.server system.

Installation
------------

Bio-Formats is already part of the OMERO clients so everything you need comes with the appropriate OMERO installation for your system, available from `OMERO downloads <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/omero/downloads>`_

Upgrading
---------

The OMERO clients are currently distributed with a static version of
Bio-Formats bundled within the **jar\_0.jar** or **omero.importer.jar**
file, and cannot be easily upgraded using the latest **loci\_tools.jar**
on the :bf_plone:`Bio-Formats downloads page <downloads>`. You should upgrade 
to the latest version of the OMERO.importer client instead.
