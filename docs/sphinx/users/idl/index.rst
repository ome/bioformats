IDL
===

`IDL <http://www.exelisvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL.aspx>`_ (Interactive
Data Language) is a popular data visualization and analysis platform
used for interactive processing of large amounts of data including
images.

IDL possesses the ability to interact with Java applications via its
IDL-Java bridge. Karsten Rodenacker has written a script that uses
Bio-Formats to read in image files to IDL.

Installation
------------

Download the `ij_read_bio_formats.pro
<http://karo03.bplaced.net/karo/IDL/_pro/ij_read_bio_formats.pro>`_ script
from Karsten Rodenacker's `IDL goodies (?)
<http://karo03.bplaced.net/karo/ro_embed.php?file=IDL/index.html>`_ web site.
See the comments at the top of the script for installation instructions
and caveats.

Upgrading
---------

To use a newer version of Bio-Formats, overwrite the requisite JAR files
with the :downloads:`newer version <>` and restart IDL.
