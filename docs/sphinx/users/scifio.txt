SCientific Imaging Formats Input and Output
===========================================

Motivation
----------

SCIFIO is a refactoring of :doc:`Bio-Formats </about/index>`.
Classic Bio-Formats uses OME-XML_ to model the metadata for a given image,
standardizing all supported formats to this schema. This tight integration,
along with the naming itself of Bio-Formats, discourages potential users from
outside the life sciences (if their imaging requirements include metadata
outside the OME-XML specification). Furthermore, the steps of processing image
formats are obfuscated by their consolidation into a single **Reader**
class; this increases the entry barrier for 3rd party developers to add
support for additional formats. Finally, the GPL licensing of
Bio-Formats precludes its inclusion in non-GPL software packages such as
ImageJ, ITK, VCell and VisAD.

SCIFIO aims to resolve these issues by reversing the OME-XML dependency
and teasing apart the stages of image format conversion and processing.
SCIFIO will define the core components of flexible image format support.
OME-XML will become one type of metadata, which Bio-Formats will still
use to standardize the metadata of a wide variety of image formats. Thus
Bio-Formats will become an extension to SCIFIO, but the underlying
structure will allow any number of such extensions to coexist. Dynamic
discovery mechanisms will allow these modules to be used as needed, as
long as the underlying program incorporates the SCIFIO core. Further,
the SCIFIO core will include support only for the open source formats
currently supported by Bio-Formats, allowing distribution under the BSD
license (though individual modules can fall under any licensing
framework, and Bio-Formats will continue to have a dual GPL + commercial
license).

Components
----------

Metadata
~~~~~~~~

Metadata is the currency of SCIFIO. Practically every component will
either create a Metadata object, take one as input, or both. It is the
tangible representation of how a particular format structures its image
metadata. One immediate improvement in this representation of the
metadata is the opportunity for a dramatic speedup in performance: by
serializing and writing a Metadata object to disk, we can eliminate the
need to parse an image more than once. Come back after a week or a month
to reanalyze a dataset and one of the most significant performance
bottlenecks in Bio-Formats will be gone.

Checker
~~~~~~~

The Checker series of classes will encapsulate the functionality
represented in the current Bio-Formats Reader classes by the isThisType
method.  A Checker for a given image format takes as input a file name
and tests whether or not it is recognized, and thus supported, returning
the result of the test.  This separation lightens the process of finding
an appropriate Parser for the image and helps to elucidate the flow of
image I/O.

Parser
~~~~~~

The first step of actually interacting with an image file will be
determining its metadata. A Parser must be created for each supported
image format. If its corresponding Checker indicates the current image
file matches a Parser’s type, the Parser examines the image’s header and
returns a Metadata object with information specific to its type. This
Metadata object can then be passed to a Translator for continued
analysis, written to disk for future use, and/or passed directly to a
Reader.

Translator
~~~~~~~~~~

Once the Metadata is isolated, a Translator can be used to convert the
original Metadata format to a new format. Each Translator encodes a 1:1
conversion between formats of Metadata objects. In general, the goal of
each Translator is to convert from a specific Metadata format to
something more general, allowing format-agnostic components to accept
the Metadata object even if it originated from a PFF image.

Reader
~~~~~~

A Reader takes in an appropriate format-specific Metadata object and
uses it to interpret the raw pixels of the original image. The final
output is a set of byte arrays, which can be interpreted by a Writer
and/or the parent software.

Writer
~~~~~~

Writers will likely be very similar to their current form in
Bio-Formats. Each Writer will take a Metadata object (often, but not
necessarily, format-agnostic) and byte array as input, and write to a
random access output stream (e.g. a file on disk).

Additional Improvements
-----------------------

LOCI Common
~~~~~~~~~~~

With a tighter integration of the random access streams from the
loci.common library, it made sense to migrate these parts to SCIFIO. As
this removed some significant functionality from loci.common, the entire
library was incorporated into sub-packages of SCIFIO.

Multi-dimensionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As classic Bio-Formats was bound to the OME-XML schema, any image
processed by Bio-Formats was forced to a five-dimensional format.
However, there is nothing inherently tied to dimensionality in SCIFIO.
Thus, SCIFIO will support full N-dimensionality in data and leave any
restrictions to the dictation of individual modules.
