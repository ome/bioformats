Subimager
=========

`Subimager <https://github.com/CellProfiler/subimager>`_, the SUBprocess
IMAGE servER, is an HTTP server that uses Bio-Formats as a back-end to
serve .TIF images. Subimager is designed to be run as a subprocess of
CellProfiler to provide CellProfiler with the capability to read and
write a variety of image formats. It can be used as a stand-alone image
server. It was developed by the `Broad
Institute <http://www.broadinstitute.org/>`_ to facilitate integration
with their CellProfiler_ image analysis application.
