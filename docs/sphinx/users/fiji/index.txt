Fiji
====

`Fiji <http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/>`_ is an image processing package. It
can be described as a distribution of :doc:`/users/imagej/index`
together with Java, Java 3D and a lot of plugins organized into a
`coherent menu
structure <http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/wiki/index.php/Plugins_Menu>`_.
Fiji compares to ImageJ as Ubuntu compares to Linux.

Fiji works with Bio-Formats out of the box, because it comes bundled
with the :doc:`Bio-Formats ImageJ plugins </users/imagej/index>`.

Upgrading
---------

Upgrading Bio-Formats within Fiji is as simple as invoking the "Update
Fiji" command from the Help menu. By default, Fiji even automatically
checks for updates every time it is launched, so you will always be
notified when new versions of Bio-Formats (or any other bundled plugin)
are available.

Updates in the Fiji updater are not always Bio-Formats’ most recent
trunk build or stable release; they are versions that are known to
remain compatible with other plugins that depend upon Bio-Formats. You
should use the Fiji updater if you use other plugins that might use
Bio-Formats.  However, if you encounter a bug within Bio-Formats, use
Bio-Formats’ own updater to see if the latest trunk build fixes it.
