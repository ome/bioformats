ImageJ
======

`ImageJ <http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/>`_ is an image processing and
analysis application written in Java, widely used in the life sciences
fields, with an extensible plugin infrastructure. You can use
Bio-Formats as a plugin for ImageJ to read and write images in the
formats it supports.

Installation
------------

Download :bf_plone:`loci_tools.jar <downloads>` and drop it into your 
**ImageJ/plugins** folder. Next time you run ImageJ, a new
LOCI submenu with several plugins will appear in the Plugins menu,
including the Bio-Formats Importer and Bio-Formats Exporter.

Usage
-----

The Bio-Formats Importer plugin can display image stacks in several
ways:

-  In a standard ImageJ window (including as a hyperstack)
-  Using the `LOCI Data Browser <http://loci.wisc.edu/software/data-browser>`_ plugin (included)
-  With Joachim Walter's
   `Image5D <http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/image5d.html>`_ plugin
   (if installed)
-  With Rainer Heintzmann's
   `View5D <http://www.nanoimaging.de/View5D>`_ plugin (if installed)

ImageJ v1.37 and later automatically (via HandleExtraFileTypes) calls
the Bio-Formats logic, if installed, as needed when a file is opened
within ImageJâ€”e.g., when using File/Open instead of explicitly choosing
"Bio-Formats Importer" from the Plugins/LOCI menu.

For a more detailed description of each plugin, see the `Bio-Formats
page <http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/wiki/index.php/Bio-Formats>`_ of the
Fiji wiki.

Upgrading
---------

To upgrade, just overwrite the old **loci_tools.jar** with the 
:bf_plone:`latest one <downloads>`.
Step-by-step upgrade instructions for Windows are available
:doc:`here <upgrading-importer>`.

You may want to download the latest version of ImageJ first, to take
advantage of new features and bug-fixes.

As of the 4.0.0 release, you can also upgrade the Bio-Formats plugin
directly from ImageJ. Select "Plugins>LOCI>Update LOCI Plugins" from the
ImageJ menu, then select which release you would like to use. You will
then need to restart ImageJ to complete the upgrade process.

Macros and Plugins
------------------

Bio-Formats is fully scriptable in a macro, and callable from a plugin.
To use in a macro, use the Macro Recorder to record a call to the
Bio-Formats Importer with the desired options. You can also perform more
targeted metadata queries using the Bio-Formats macro extensions.

Here are some example ImageJ macros and plugins that use Bio-Formats to get you started:

:source:`basicMetadata.txt <components/loci-plugins/utils/macros/basicMetadata.txt>` - A macro that uses the Bio-Formats macro extensions to print the chosen file's basic dimensional parameters to the Log.

:source:`planeTimings.txt <components/loci-plugins/utils/macros/planeTimings.txt>` - A macro that uses the Bio-Formats macro extensions to print the chosen file's plane timings to the Log.

:source:`recursiveTiffConvert.txt <components/loci-plugins/utils/macros/recursiveTiffConvert.txt>` - A macro for recursively converting files to TIFF using Bio-Formats.

:source:`bfOpenAsHyperstack.txt <components/loci-plugins/utils/macros/bfOpenAsHyperstack.txt>` - This macro from Wayne Rasband opens a file as a hyperstack using only the Bio-Formats macro extensions (without calling the Bio-Formats Importer plugin).

:source:`zvi2HyperStack.txt <components/loci-plugins/utils/macros/zvi2HyperStack.txt>` - This macro from Sebastien Huart reads in a ZVI file using Bio-Formats, synthesizes the LUT using emission wavelength metadata, and displays the result as a hyperstack.

:source:`dvSplitTimePoints.txt <components/loci-plugins/utils/macros/dvSplitTimePoints.txt>` - This macro from Sebastien Huart splits timepoints/channels on all DV files in a folder.

:source:`batchTiffConvert.txt <components/loci-plugins/utils/macros/batchTiffConvert.txt>` - This macro converts all files in a directory to TIFF using the Bio-Formats macro extensions.

:source:`Read_Image <components/loci-plugins/utils/Read_Image.java>` - A simple plugin that demonstrates how to use Bio-Formats to read files into ImageJ.

:source:`Mass_Importer <components/loci-plugins/utils/Mass_Importer.java>` - A simple plugin that demonstrates how to open all image files in a directory using Bio-Formats, grouping files with similar names to avoiding opening the same dataset more than once.
