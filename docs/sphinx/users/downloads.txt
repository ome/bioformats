Please note:

-  Internet Explorer sometimes renames JAR files to ZIP (e.g.,
   **loci\_tools.jar** becomes **loci\_tools.zip**); if this happens to
   you, simply rename the file back to its original name after the
   download is complete.
-  For some browsers, you may need to right-click or control-click the
   link and choose "Save link as..." or similar option to download the
   file.
-  What to do with the file depends on how you want to use Bio-Formats;
   see the Applications menu at left.
