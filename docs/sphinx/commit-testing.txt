Testing individual commits (internal developers)
================================================

At the bottom of many commit messages in
`https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats <https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats>`_,
you will find a few lines similar to this:

::

    To test, please run:

    ant -Dtestng.directory=$DATA/metamorph test-automated

This shows the command(s) necessary to run automated tests against the
files likely to be affected by that commit. If you want to run these
tests, you will need to do the following:

Clone bioformats.git and checkout the appropriate branch (by following
the directions on the :omerodoc:`Git usage <developers/Development/UsingGit.html>`
page). Run this command to build all of the JAR files:

::

    $ ant clean jars

Switch to the test-suite component:

::

    $ cd components/test-suite

Run the tests, where $DATA is the path to the full data repository:

::

    $ ant -Dtestng.directory=$DATA/metamorph test-automated

By default, 512 MB of memory are allocated to the JVM. You can increase
this by adding the '-Dtestng.memory=XXXm' option. You should now see
output similar to this:

::

    Buildfile: build.xml

    init-title:
         [echo] ----------=========== loci-testing-framework ===========----------

    init-timestamp:

    init-version:

    init-manifest-cp:

    init:

    copy-source:

    compile:

    test-automated:
       [testng] [Parser] Running:
       [testng]   LOCI software test suite
       [testng] 
       [testng] Scanning for files...
       [testng] Building list of tests...
       [testng] Ready to test 490 files
       [testng] ........................................

and then eventually:

::

       [testng] ===============================================
       [testng] LOCI software test suite
       [testng] Total tests run: 19110, Failures: 0, Skips: 0
       [testng] ===============================================
       [testng] 

    BUILD SUCCESSFUL
    Total time: 16 minutes 42 seconds

Each of the dots represents a single passed test; a '-' is a skipped
test, and an 'F' is a failed test. This is mostly just for your
amusement if you happen to be staring at the console while the tests
run, as a more detailed report is logged to
loci-software-test-$DATE.log (where "$DATE" is the date on which the tests
started in "yyyy-MM-dd_hh-mm-ss" format).

If Ant reports that the build was successful, then there is nothing that
you need to do. Otherwise, it is helpful if you can provide the command,
branch name, number of failures at the bottom of the Ant output, and the
loci-software-test-\*.log file.
