explains the goal of the software, discusses how it processes metadata, and
provides other useful information such as version history and how to report
bugs. :doc:`users/index` focuses on how to use Bio-Formats as a plugin for
ImageJ and Fiji, and also gives details of other software packages which can
use Bio-Formats to read and write microscopy formats.
:doc:`developers/index` covers more indepth information on using
Bio-Formats as a Java library and how to interface from non-Java codes.
Finally, :doc:`formats/index` is a guide to all the file formats currently
supported by Bio-Formats.
