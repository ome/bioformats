Bio-Formats Documentation
#########################

Bio-Formats is a standalone Java library for reading and writing
microscopy file formats, written by the Open Microscopy Environment
consortium. It is capable of parsing both pixels and metadata for more
than 120 file formats, as well as writing to several formats. It also
includes standardized metadata conversion to OME-XML and OME-TIFF.

Full details, including the very impressive list of supported file
formats, are available at the `LOCI website
<http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats>`_.

The primary goal of Bio-Formats is to facilitate the exchange of
microscopy data between both different software packages and different
organizations, by converting proprietary microscopy data into the `OME
data model standard <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/file-formats>`_. See our `recent
article <http://jcb.rupress.org/content/189/5/777.abstract>`_ on
biological image formats and the `Bio-Formats statement of
purpose <http://loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/about>`_ for more
information.

Bio-Formats is released under the `GNU General Public License (GPL)

from `Glencoe Software <http://www.glencoesoftware.com>`_.
