Bio-Formats Documentation
#########################

The following documentation is split into four sections. :doc:`about` explains the goal of the software and discusses how it processes metadata. :doc:`users/user-info` focusses on how to use Bio-Formats as a plugin for ImageJ and Fiji, and also gives details of other software packages which can use Bio-Formats to read and write microscopy formats. :doc:`developers/developer-links` covers more indepth information on using Bio-Formats as a Java library and how to interface from non-Java codes. Finally, :doc:`supported-formats` is a guide to all the file formats currently supported by Bio-Formats.
