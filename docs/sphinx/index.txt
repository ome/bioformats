Bio-Formats is a standalone Java library for reading and writing life
sciences image file formats. It is capable of parsing both pixels and
metadata for a large number of formats, as well as writing to several
formats. 

Bio-Formats's primary purpose is to convert proprietary microscopy data into
an open standard called the `OME data model <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_, 
particularly into the OME-TIFF_file format.
