Reporting a bug
===============

Before filing a bug report
--------------------------

If you think you have found a bug in Bio-Formats, the first thing to do is
update your version of Bio-Formats to the latest trunk version. It is
possible that the problem has already been addressed. For both Fiji and
ImageJ users, select Update LOCI Plugins under the LOCI menu. Select
Trunk Build.

You can also download the :bf_plone:`newest version of Bio-Formats <downloads>`. 
If you are not sure which version you need, select the Trunk Build under LOCI 
Tools complete bundle.

Sending a bug report
--------------------

If you can still reproduce the bug after updating to the newest version
of Bio-Formats, please send us a bug report. To ensure that any
inquiries you make are resolved promptly, please include the following
information:

-  **Exact error message**. Copy and paste any error messages into the
   text of your email. Alternatively, attach a screenshot of the
   relevant windows.
-  **Version information**. Indicate which release of Bio-Formats, which
   operating system, and which version of Java you are using.
-  **Non-working data**. If possible, please send a non-working file.
   This helps us ensure that the problem is fixed for next release and
   will not reappear in later releases. We can provide you with an FTP
   server for uploading your file(s) if needed. Note that any data
   provided is used for internal testing only; we do not make images
   publicly available unless given explicit permission to do so.
-  **Metadata and screenshots**. If possible, include any additional
   information about your data. We are especially interested in the
   expected dimensions (width, height, number of channels, Z slices, and
   timepoints). Screenshots of the image being successfully opened in
   other software are also useful.
-  **Format details**. If you are requesting support for a new format,
   we ask that you send as much data as you have regarding this format
   (sample files, specifications, vendor/manufacturer information,
   etc.). This helps us to better support the format and ensures future
   versions of the format are also supported.

Once you have gathered all the relevant information, send it as an
e-mail to the `OME Users mailing list <http://lists.openmicroscopy.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/ome-users/>`_.

**Please be patient** - it may be a few days until you receive a
response, but we reply to *every* email inquiry we receive.
