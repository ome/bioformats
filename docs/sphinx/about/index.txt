About Bio-Formats
=================

Bio-Formats is a standalone Java library for reading and writing life
sciences image file formats. It is capable of parsing both pixels and
metadata for a large number of formats, as well as writing to several
formats.

The primary goal of Bio-Formats is to facilitate the exchange of
microscopy data between different software packages and
organizations. It achieves this by converting proprietary
microscopy data into an open standard called the `OME data
model <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_, particularly into the
:model_doc:`OME-TIFF <ome-tiff>` file format.

We believe the standardization of microscopy metadata to a common
structure is of vital importance to the community. A brief `article on the
benefits of
standardization <http://www.thinkstandards.net/benefits.html>`_ from
`thinkstandards.net <http://www.thinkstandards.net/>`_ provides an
excellent summary.

Bio-Formats metadata processing
-------------------------------

Pixels in microscopy are almost always very straightforward, stored on
evenly spaced rectangular grids. It is the metadata (details about the
acquisition, experiment, user, and other information) that can be
complex. Using the OME data model enables applications to support a
single metadata format, rather than the multitude of proprietary formats
available today.

Every file format has a distinct set of metadata, stored differently.
Bio-Formats processes and converts each format's metadata structures
into a standard form called the `OME data
model <http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/5/R47>`_, according to the
:model_doc:`OME-XML <ome-xml>` specification. We have defined an open exchange
format called :model_doc:`OME-TIFF <ome-tiff>` that stores its metadata as
OME-XML. Any software package that supports OME-TIFF is also compatible with
the dozens of formats listed on the Bio-Formats page, because Bio-Formats can
convert your files to OME-TIFF format.

To facilitate support of OME-XML, we have created a
:model_doc:`library in Java <ome-xml/java-library.html>` for reading and
writing :model_doc:`OME-XML <ome-xml>` metadata.

There are three types of metadata in Bio-Formats, which we call core
metadata, original metadata, and OME metadata.

#. **Core metadata** only includes things necessary to understand
   the basic structure of the pixels: image resolution; number of focal
   planes, time points, channels, and other dimensional axes; byte
   order; dimension order; color arrangement (RGB, indexed color or
   separate channels); and thumbnail resolution.

#. **Original metadata** is information specific to a
   particular file format. These fields are key/value pairs in the
   original format, with no guarantee of cross-format naming consistency
   or compatibility. Nomenclature often differs between formats, as each
   vendor is free to use their own terminology.

#. **OME metadata** is information from #1 and #2 converted by Bio-Formats
   into the OME data model. **Performing this conversion is the primary
   purpose of Bio-Formats.** Bio-Formats uses its ability to convert
   proprietary metadata into OME-XML as part of its integration with the
   OME and OMERO serversâ€” essentially, they are able to populate their
   databases in a structured way because Bio-Formats sorts the metadata
   into the proper places. This conversion is nowhere near complete or
   bug free, but we are constantly working to improve it. We would
   greatly appreciate any and all input from users concerning missing or
   improperly converted metadata fields.

Bio-Formats versions
--------------------

Bio-Formats is updated whenever a significant bug fix is made, or whenever a
new version of :omerodoc:`OMERO <>` is released. The version number is three 
numbers separated by dots; e.g., 4.0.0. See the :doc:`version history <whats-new>` 
for a list of major changes in each release.

The latest stable version of Bio-Formats is |release|. For future
development directions, see the
`4.5 <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/query?group=status&component=Bio-Formats&milestone=OMERO-4.5>`_
and `5.0 <http://trac.openmicroscopy.org.uk/ome/query?group=status&component=Bio-Formats&milestone=OMERO-5.0>`_
roadmaps.
