OMERO
=====

`OMERO <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4>`_ is a
Java-based server-client application for microscope image data
management, visualization, and analysis. See the `OMERO
documentation <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero4>`_ for
details. The :omerodoc:`OMERO.importer <users/clients-overview.html#omero-importer>`
client uses Bio-Formats to read image pixels and propagate metadata into
the OMERO.server system.

Installation
------------

Everything you need comes with the OMERO clients, with no further
installation necessary.

Upgrading
---------

The OMERO clients are currently distributed with a static version of
Bio-Formats bundled within the **jar\_0.jar** or **omero.importer.jar**
file, and cannot be easily upgraded using the latest **loci\_tools.jar**
on this web page. Instead, wait for a new version of the OMERO.importer
client.
