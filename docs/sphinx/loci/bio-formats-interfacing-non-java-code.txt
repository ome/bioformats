Interfacing From Non-Java Code
==============================

Bio-Formats is written in Java, and is easiest to use with other Java
code. However, it is possible to call Bio-Formats from a program written
in another language. But how to do so depends on your program's needs.

Technologically, there are two broad categories of solutions:
**in-process** approaches, and **inter-process** communication. See
below for discussion and examples of each. For further reading, check
out `Codemesh's technology
comparison <http://codemesh.com/technology.html>`_.

Recommended **in-process solution**: :doc:`bio-formats-bio-formats-c-bindings`

Recommended **inter-process solution**: `Bio-Formats Ice bindings <http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/formats-ice.html>`_

In-process approaches
---------------------

With an `in-process <http://codemesh.com/in_process.html>`_ approach,
your application directly invokes Java code, either by spawning its own
internal Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and passing data across a bridge, or
otherwise executing the Java code within a single environment.

Strengths
#. Tight (API-level) integration
#. Minimal performance overhead
#. Few security considerations

Weaknesses

#. No shared state between processes
#. Limited portability

**Paradigms:**

-  *JNI* – The most common paradigm is the `Java Native
   Interface <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface>`_, an
   API for interfacing Java programs with
   `native <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_mode>`_ C/C++ code.
   Functionality exists to 1) call C/C++ methods from Java, and 2) spawn
   a Java Virtual Machine and execute Java instructions from C/C++. The
   latter direction, known as `Java
   Invocation <http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/invocation.html>`_,
   is the relevant one for calling Bio-Formats from C++. Because using
   the JNI directly involves writing a lot of tedious glue code, several
   projects have emerged for autogenerating such code.
   *See below: raw JNI, Jace, JunC++ion, JuggerNET*
-  *Compilers* – The dominant paradigm in Java is to compile Java source
   to Java bytecode, then execute the bytecode in a Java interpreter.
   However, an alternative is to compile the Java source directly to
   native code so that it can link with other native programs. Such an
   approach requires that the compiler provide correct support for all
   necessary Java standard library features. It may also exhibit much
   different performance (for better or for worse) than Sun's Java
   implementation does.
   *See below: GCJ*
-  *Runtimes* – The safest way to guarantee correct program behavior is
   to execute Java bytecode using the Java interpreter(s) with which it
   has been tested (which in the case of Bio-Formats is Sun's
   implementation). However, a Java runtime written using a specific
   framework (e.g., .NET) could enable seamless integration with other
   (non-Java) programs within the same framework. Like the
   compiler-based paradigm above, though, it is reliant on the
   correctness, completeness and performance of the Java implementation
   in question.
   *See below: IKVM.NET*

Inter-process communication
---------------------------

The other approach is `inter-process
communication <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication>`_,
a broad collection of techniques for exchanging data between multiple
running programs. Such techniques take many forms in computing; one
ubiquitous example is web browsers and web servers. Most solutions in
this category are some form of
`middleware <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware>`_.

Strengths

#. Share state between multiple processes on multiple machines
#. Broad portability and language support

Weaknesses

#. `Object marshalling <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_%28computer_science%29>`_
   incurs significant overhead
#. Potentially vulnerable to security exploits

**Paradigms:**

-  *Local communication* – Modern operating systems provide several ways
   to share information between processes, including shared memory, file
   system access, and passing data back and forth with `standard nput
   and output streams <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams>`_.
   *See below: pipes, files*
-  *Messaging* – Networking technology allows a process on one computer
   to send and receive messages from another process on a different
   machine. The
   `client-server <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-server>`_ model
   is probably most applicable for Java/native integration, with the
   Java portion acting as a server that can be queried from the native
   code.
   *See below: sockets, XML-RPC*
-  *ORB* – An `object request
   broker <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_request_broker>`_ (ORB)
   is a high-level form of middleware for transferring objects between
   multiple running programs. ORBs provide an abstraction that can
   reduce and simplify code written by providing access to a wealth of
   higher-level messaging features.
   *See below: Ice, CORBA, Codemesh Shared JVM*

List of solutions
-----------------

It is a significant challenge to access a complex Java API from code
written in another language, especially in a cross-platform and high
performance way. The table below provides an overview of viable
approaches, with links to source code and instructions where
appropriate. Which approach to use depends on your application's target
platforms and languages, and the interaction model between your
application and the Java code—see the discussion of in-process solutions
versus inter-process communication above for details.

**A note about SWIG.** The `Simplified Wrapper and Interface
Generator <http://www.swig.org/>`_ (SWIG) is an excellent tool for
exposing C++ functionality to higher level languages such as Java.
Unfortunately, calling native code from Java is the wrong direction for
our purposes. However, when combined with an integration solution
specific to C++, SWIG could be used to extend that solution into other
languages (see `SWIG's list of supported
languages <http://www.swig.org/compat.html#SupportedLanguages>`_ for a
complete list).

Notes

`Raw
JNI <http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/invocation.html>`_

In-process (JNI)

C/C++

-  You can code your integration layer using pure JNI calls (but we
   don't recommend it).
-  Low-level JNI offers full control over the interface between Java and
   native code.
-  Raw JNI solutions are `time-consuming and
   error-prone <http://codemesh.com/technology.html#jni>`_ to implement.
-  We have coded `a simple
   example
   <http://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/tree/develop/components/bio-formats/utils/showinfJNI.cpp>`_
   for calling Bio-Formats this way.
-  We recommend a higher level integration solution such as Jace
   instead.

`Jace <http://sourceforge.net/projects/jace/>`_

In-process (JNI)

C/C++

-  Jace generates C++ proxy classes, one per Java class, mirroring the
   original functionality as much as possible.
-  The C++ proxy classes use JNI under the hood but handle most of the
   usual JNI pitfalls.
-  We provide a set of :doc:`Bio-Formats C++
   bindings <bio-formats-bio-formats-c-bindings>` using
   Jace.

`JunC++ion <http://codemesh.com/products/junction/>`_

In-process (JNI)

C/C++

-  JunC++ion is a commercial in-process integration solution for C/C++
   available from `Codemesh, Inc. <http://www.codemesh.com/>`_

`JuggerNET <http://codemesh.com/products/juggernet/>`_

In-process (JNI)

.NET

-  JuggerNET is a commercial in-process integration solution for .NET
   available from `Codemesh, Inc. <http://www.codemesh.com/>`_

`GCJ <http://gcc.gnu.org/java/>`_

In-process (compiler)

C/C++ (GCC only)

-  GCJ can compile Java code into machine code.
-  Instead of JNI, GCJ uses its `Compiler Native
   Interface <http://gcc.gnu.org/java/papers/cni/t1.html>`_ (CNI) to
   enable access to Java code from C++.
-  Works with GCC only (i.e., not with Microsoft Visual C++ or other
   compilers).
-  Correctness and performance is dependent on the compiler
   implementation.

`IKVM.NET <http://www.ikvm.net/>`_

In-process (runtime)

.NET/Mono

-  IKVM.NET interprets Java byte code on the fly into the .NET/Mono
   framework.
-  Interoperability is limited to applications in the .NET/Mono
   framework.
-  Correctness and performance is dependent on the runtime
   implementation.

`Pipes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29>`_

Inter-process (local)

Any

-  Pipes can work well when quantity of data being transferred is
   limited.
-  Be careful about blocking operations causing deadlock.
-  The `OME Perl
   server <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/legacy/ome-server>`_ uses
   a combination of pipes and files to interface with Bio-Formats.

`Files <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file>`_

Inter-process (local)

Any

-  Communication via files is slower than pipes, since messages go
   through disk.
-  The size of the communication buffer is limited only by available
   disk space.
-  The `OME Perl
   server <http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/products/legacy/ome-server>`_ uses
   a combination of pipes and files to interface with Bio-Formats.

`Sockets <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket>`_

Inter-process (messaging)

Any

-  You can use a sockets API directly to create a custom solution (but
   we don't recommend it).
-  `JVMLink <http://www.loci.wisc.edu/software/jvmlink>`_ was our first
   cut at such a solution, before we realized that we were essentially
   inventing our own middleware.
-  We recommend using Ice or CORBA instead.

`XML-RPC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC>`_

Inter-process (messaging)

`Many <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC#Implementations>`_

-  XML-RPC is a cross-platform `remote procedure
   call <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call>`_ (RPC)
   technology using XML.
-  XML-RPC is a human readable, but inefficient, means of transporting
   information.
-  See also: `SOAP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP_%28protocol%29>`_

Ice_

Inter-process (ORB)

Several

-  Ice is high-performance middleware for cross-platform client/server
   communication.
-  ZeroC_ argues that Ice is `superior to
   CORBA <http://www.zeroc.com/iceVsCorba.html>`_.
-  We provide a set of `Bio-Formats Ice
   bindings <http://www.loci.wisc.edu/ome/formats-ice.html>`_.

`CORBA <http://java.sun.com/j2ee/corba/>`_

Inter-process (ORB)

Many

-  `Java RMI over IIOP <http://java.sun.com/products/rmi-iiop/>`_
   enables communication between Java and other CORBA-supported
   languages.
-  CORBA is a mature technology with widespread use in the enterprise
   community.
-  Support for CORBA is built in to the Java 2 platform.
-  Nonetheless, where possible we suggest you use Ice instead.

`Codemesh Shared JVM <http://codemesh.com/shared_jvm.html>`_

Inter-process (ORB)

C++, .NET

-  The Codemesh Shared JVM is a commercial inter-process integration
   solution available from `Codemesh, Inc. <http://www.codemesh.com/>`_
