Notes: 

-  Bio-Formats has two modes of operation for QuickTime:

   -  QTJava mode requires
      `QuickTime <http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/>`_ to be
      installed.
   -  Native mode works on systems with no QuickTime (e.g., Linux).

-  Bio-Formats can save image stacks as QuickTime movies.
-  The following table shows supported codecs:

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] RLE-compressed QuickTime movies will look funny if the planes are not 
        read in sequential order, since proper decoding of a particular plane 
        can depend on the previous plane.
