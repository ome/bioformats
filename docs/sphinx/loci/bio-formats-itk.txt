ITK
===

`ITK <http://itk.org/>`_ (Insight Toolkit) is an open-source,
cross-platform system that provides developers with an extensive suite
of software tools for image analysis. Developed through extreme
programming methodologies, ITK employs leading-edge algorithms for
registering and segmenting multidimensional data.

ITK provides an ImageIO plugin structure that works via discovery though
a dependency injection scheme. This allows a program built on ITK to
load plugins for reading and writing different image types without
actually linking to the ImageIO libraries required for those types. Such
encapsulation automatically grants two major boons: firstly, programs
can be easily extended just by virtue of using ITK (developers don't
have to specifically accommodate or anticipate what plugins may be
used). Secondly, the architecture provides a distribution method for
open source software, like Bio-Formats, which have licenses that might
otherwise exclude them from being used with other software suites.

The Bio-Formats ITK plugin provides an ImageIO plugin for ITK that uses
`Bio-Formats <http://farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/Bio-Formats>`_ to read
and write supported life sciences file formats. This plugin allows any
program built on ITK to read any of the image types supported by
Bio-Formats.

Installation
------------

There are two main options for installing the BF-ITK plugin:

-  You can download a binary distribution of BF-ITK from the
   :doc:`Downloads <bio-formats-downloads>` page.
-  To build BF-ITK yourself, see "Compiling from source" below.

Either way, see "Usage" for details on how to run the plugin.

Usage
-----

To use BF-ITK, you must set your ``ITK_AUTOLOAD_PATH`` to point to the
folder containing the BF-ITK binaries (including the ``BioFormatsIO``
and ``BioFormatsIOPlugin`` shared libraries, and the ``loci_tools.jar``
Java library). For example:

    `` export ITK_AUTOLOAD_PATH=~/bf-itk-build/dist/bf-itk``

Once this variable is set, ITK's ImageIO routines will automatically use
Bio-Formats as needed to read and write supported file formats.

If you built ITK with examples, you can test using various programs:

    `` cd ~/itk-build/bin ./ImageReadWrite ~/data/inputFile.ics ~/data/outputFile.mha``

Compiling from source
---------------------

You can compile the Bio-Formats ITK plugin (BF-ITK) from source by
performing the following steps:

#. If you have not done so already, `download <http://itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html>`_
   and build ITK . Note that BF-ITK requires ITK 3.20.0 or newer. It should 
   also work with the latest `ITK source from Git <http://www.itk.org/Wiki/ITK/Git>`_.

#. Clone the `Bio-Formats source
   code <http://www.loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/source-code>`_:

       `` git clone git://dev.loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats.git``

#. Compile the Bio-Formats tools bundle:

       `` cd bio-formats ant tools``

#. Configure your BF-ITK build:

       `` mkdir ../bf-itk-build && cd ../bf-itk-build ccmake ../bio-formats/components/native/bf-itk-pipe``

   If you prefer, you can use cmake-gui rather than ccmake to configure
   the project. If you receive a configuration error stating that the
   location of ITK cannot be found, then set ITK\_DIR to your binary
   build of ITK. Note that BF-ITK requires ITK 3.20.0 or newer.

#. Compile BF-ITK:

       `` make``

   On Windows, it should work to build with Visual Studio rather than
   make.

#. All needed libraries including ``loci_tools.jar`` will be copied to
   ``dist/bf-itk`` inside the BF-ITK build folder. You can also package
   everything into a single archive by running:

       `` make package``

#. For instructions on running BF-ITK, see "Usage" above.
