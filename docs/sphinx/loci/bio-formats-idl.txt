IDL
===

`IDL <http://www.exelisvis.com/ProductsServices/IDL.aspx>`_ (Interactive
Data Language) is a popular data visualization and analysis platform
used for interactive processing of large amounts of data including
images.

IDL possesses the ability to interact with Java applications via its
IDL-Java bridge. Karsten Rodenacker has written a script that uses
Bio-Formats to read in image files to IDL.

Installation
------------

Download the `**ij\_read\_bio\_formats.pro**
script <http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/ibb/homepage/karsten.rodenacker/IDL/_pro/ij_read_bio_formats.pro>`_
from Karsten Rodenacker's `IDL goodies (?) web
site <http://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/ibb/homepage/karsten.rodenacker/IDL/index.php>`_.
See the comments at the top of the script for installation instructions
and caveats.

Upgrading
---------

To use a newer version of Bio-Formats, overwrite the requisite JAR files
with the :doc:`newer
version <bio-formats-downloads>` and restart
IDL.
