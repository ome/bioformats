FIJI Updaters
=============

Using FIJI's updaters
---------------------

FIJI includes a separate updater that updates multiple plugins, including 
Bio-Formats. You can find it under FIJI’s help menu.

Updates in the FIJI updater are not always Bio-Formats’ most recent
trunk build or stable release; they are versions that are known to
remain compatible with other plugins that depend upon Bio-Formats. You
should use the FIJI updater if you use other plugins that might use
Bio-Formats.  However, if you encounter a bug within Bio-Formats, use
Bio-Formats’ own updater to see if the latest trunk build fixes it.
