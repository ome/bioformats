FIJI Updaters
=============

Using FIJI's updaters
---------------------

If you are using FIJI, there is a separate updater that updates multiple
plugins, including Bio-Formats. You can find it under FIJI’s help menu.

|FIJI Updater|\ **FIJI Updater** 

Updates in the FIJI updater are not always Bio-Formats’ most recent
trunk build or stable release; they are versions that are known to
remain compatible with other plugins that depend upon Bio-Formats. You
should use the FIJI updater if you use other plugins that might use
Bio-Formats.  However, if you encounter a bug within Bio-Formats, use
Bio-Formats’ own updater to see if the latest trunk build fixes it.
