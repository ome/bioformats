MATLAB
======

`MATLAB <http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/>`_ is a high-level
language and interactive environment that facilitates rapid development
of algorithms for performing computationally intensive tasks.

Calling Bio-Formats from MATLAB is fairly straightforward, since MATLAB
has built-in interoperability with Java. We have created a simple script
for reading image files:

    :source:`bfopen.m <components/bio-formats/utils/bfopen.m>`

We are not MATLAB experts—any comments on improving the script are
welcome.

Performance
-----------

In our tests (MATLAB R14 vs. java 1.6.0\_20), the script executes at
approximately half the speed of our 
:doc:`showinf command line tool <bio-formats-command-line-tools>`, due to 
overhead from copying arrays.

Installation
------------

To use the script, download **bfopen.m** (above) and
:doc:`**loci\_tools.jar** <bio-formats-downloads>` and place them in your
MATLAB work directory.

Upgrading
---------

To use a newer version of Bio-Formats, overwrite **loci\_tools.jar**
with the :doc:`newer version <bio-formats-downloads>` and restart MATLAB.
