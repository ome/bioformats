Bio-Formats as a Java library
=============================


API documentation
-----------------

If you wish to make use of Bio-Formats within your own software, you can
download bio-formats.jar to use it as a library. Just add
**bio-formats.jar** to your CLASSPATH or build path. You will also need
**loci-common.jar** for common I/O functions. :doc:`Read
more.... <bio-formats-bio-formats-java-library>`

Some of the more useful pieces of documentation are:

-  :jenkins:`Javadocs <job/BIOFORMATS-trunk/javadoc/>`

Interfacing from non-Java code
==============================


Bio-Formats is written in Java, and is easiest to use with other Java
code. However, it is possible to call Bio-Formats from a program written
in another language. But how to do so depends on your program's needs.

Bio-Formats C++ bindings
------------------------

To make the utility of the Bio-Formats Java library accessible to
software written in C++ (such as the Insight Toolkit) we have used the
Jace set of libraries to create C++ proxies of the Bio-Formats classes.
