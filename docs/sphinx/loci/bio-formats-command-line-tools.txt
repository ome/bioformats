Command Line Tools
==================

We have created several scripts for using Bio-Formats on the command
line.

Installation
------------

`Download
**bftools.zip** <http://www.loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/downloads>`_,
unzip it into a new folder, then `download
**loci\_tools.jar** <http://www.loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/downloads>`_
and place it in the same folder.

The zip file contains both Unix scripts and Windows batch files.
Currently available tools include:

-  **showinf** – Prints information about a given image file to the
   console, and displays the image itself in the Bio-Formats image
   viewer.
-  **bfview** – Launches the Bio-Formats image viewer, displaying the
   given file (if any).
-  **ijview** – Displays the given image file in ImageJ using the
   Bio-Formats Importer plugin (requires ij.jar).
-  **bfconvert** – Converts an image file from one format to another.
   Bio-Formats must support writing to the output file (determined by
   extension; see the `supported formats
   table <http://www.loci.wisc.edu/bio-formats/formats>`_).
-  **formatlist** – Displays a list of supported file formats in HTML,
   plaintext or XML.
-  **xmlindent** – A simple XML prettifier similer to
   ``xmllint --format`` but more robust in that it attempts to produce
   output regardless of syntax errors in the XML.
-  **xmlvalid** – A command-line XML validation tool, useful for
   checking an OME-XML document for compliance with the OME-XML schema.
-  **omeul** – A command-line client-side import tool for OME.
-  **tiffcomment** – Dumps the comment from the given TIFF file's first
   IFD entry; useful for examining the OME-XML block in an OME-TIFF
   file.

All scripts require **loci\_tools.jar** in the same directory as the
command line tools.

Tutorial

We have posted a `Bio-Formats command line tools
tutorial <http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/FARSIGHT_Tutorials/Bio-Formats>`_
to the FARSIGHT web site.

Using the tools directly from source
------------------------------------

If you have `checked out the source from our Subversion
repository <http://www.loci.wisc.edu/software/accessing-source-code>`_
you already have the command line tools in the ``tools`` directory. You
can configure the scripts to use your source tree instead of
**loci\_tools.jar** in the same directory by following these steps:

#. Point your CLASSPATH to the checked-out directory and the JAR files
   in the ``jar`` folder.

   -  E.g., on Windows with Java 1.6 or later, if you have checked out
      the source at ``C:\code\loci``, set your CLASSPATH environment
      variable to the value ``C:\code\loci\jar\*;C:\code\loci``. You can
      access the environment variable configuration area by
      right-clicking on My Computer, choosing Properties, Advanced tab,
      Environment Variables button.

#. Compile the source with ``ant compile``.
#. Set the ``LOCI_DEVEL`` environment variable to any value. (The
   variable just needs to be defined.)
