Command Line Tools
==================

We have created several scripts for using Bio-Formats on the command
line.

Installation
------------

:doc:`Download
**bftools.zip** <bio-formats-downloads>`,
unzip it into a new folder, then :doc:`download
**loci\_tools.jar** <bio-formats-downloads>`
and place it in the same folder.

The zip file contains both Unix scripts and Windows batch files.
Currently available tools include:

.. glossary::

    showinf
        Prints information about a given image file to the console, and 
        displays the image itself in the Bio-Formats image viewer.

    bfview
        Launches the Bio-Formats image viewer, displaying the given file (if 
        any).

    ijview
        Displays the given image file in ImageJ using the Bio-Formats Importer 
        plugin (requires ij.jar).
    
    bfconvert
        Converts an image file from one format to another. Bio-Formats must 
        support writing to the output file (determined by extension; see the 
        :ref:`supportedformats`).
        
    formatlist
        Displays a list of supported file formats in HTML, plaintext or XML.
        
    xmlindent
        A simple XML prettifier similer to ``xmllint --format`` but more 
        robust in that it attempts to produce output regardless of syntax 
        errors in the XML.
        
    xmlvalid
        A command-line XML validation tool, useful for checking an OME-XML 
        document for compliance with the OME-XML schema.

    omeul
        A command-line client-side import tool for OME.
        
    tiffcomment
        Dumps the comment from the given TIFF file's first IFD entry; useful 
        for examining the OME-XML block in an OME-TIFF file.

All scripts require **loci\_tools.jar** in the same directory as the
command line tools.

Tutorial
--------

We have posted a `Bio-Formats command line tools
tutorial <http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/FARSIGHT_Tutorials/Bio-Formats>`_
to the FARSIGHT web site.

Using the tools directly from source
------------------------------------

If you have :doc:`checked out the source from our Git
repository <bio-formats-source-code>`
you already have the command line tools in the ``tools`` directory. You
can configure the scripts to use your source tree instead of
**loci\_tools.jar** in the same directory by following these steps:

#. Point your CLASSPATH to the checked-out directory and the JAR files
   in the ``jar`` folder.

   -  E.g., on Windows with Java 1.6 or later, if you have checked out
      the source at ``C:\code\loci``, set your CLASSPATH environment
      variable to the value ``C:\code\loci\jar\*;C:\code\loci``. You can
      access the environment variable configuration area by
      right-clicking on My Computer, choosing Properties, Advanced tab,
      Environment Variables button.

#. Compile the source with ``ant compile``.
#. Set the ``LOCI_DEVEL`` environment variable to any value. (The
   variable just needs to be defined.)
