`Icy <http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/>`_ is an open-source image
analysis and visualization software package that combines a
user-friendly graphical interface with the ability to write scripts and
plugins that can be uploaded to a centralized website.  It uses
Bio-Formats internally to read images and acquisition metadata, so no
further installation is necessary.
