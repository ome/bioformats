Additional Information
----------------------

Source Code: :source:`Native ND2 Reader <components/bio-formats/src/loci/formats/in/NativeND2Reader.java>`

Source Code: :source:`Legacy ND2 Reader <components/bio-formats/src/loci/formats/in/LegacyND2Reader.java>`

Notes: There are two distinct versions of ND2: an old version, which uses
JPEG-2000 compression, and a new version which is either uncompressed or
Zip-compressed. We are not aware of the version number or release date
for either format.

Bio-Formats uses the `JAI Image I/O Tools <http://java.net/projects/jai-imageio>`_ 
library to read ND2 files compressed with JPEG-2000.

There is also an ND2 reader that uses Nikon's native libraries. To use
it, you must be using Windows and have `Nikon's ND2 reader plugin for
ImageJ <http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/nd2-reader.html>`_ installed.
Additionally, you will need to download
`LegacyND2Reader.dll <https://github.com/openmicroscopy/bioformats/raw/develop/lib/LegacyND2Reader.dll>`_
and place it in your ImageJ folder.
