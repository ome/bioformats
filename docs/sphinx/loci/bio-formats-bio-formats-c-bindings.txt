Bio-Formats C++ Bindings

Bio-Formats C++ Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make Bio-Formats accessible to software written in C++, we have
created a Bio-Formats C++ interface (BF-CPP for short). It uses our
`jar2lib <http://loci.wisc.edu/software/jar2lib>`_ program to generate a C++ 
proxy class for each equivalent Bio-Formats Java class. The resulting proxies 
are then compiled into a library, which represents the actual interface from 
C++ to Bio-Formats. Using this library in your projects gives you access to
the image support of Bio-Formats.

BF-CPP comes with some standalone examples which you can use as a
starting point in your own project:

-  :source:`showinf <components/scifio/cppwrap/showinf.cpp>`
-  :source:`minimum_writer <components/scifio/cppwrap/minimum_writer.cpp>`

Other projects using BF-CPP include:

-  We use BF-CPP in our `WiscScan <http://loci.wisc.edu/software/wiscscan>`_ 
   acquisition program to write OME-TIFF_ files.
-  :doc:`bio-formats-xuvtools` uses an adapted version of BF-CPP
   called
   `BlitzBioFormats <http://www.xuvtools.org/devel:libblitzbioformats>`_.

You can use BF-CPP from a pre-compiled binary, or you can generate the
code and compile it yourself:

-  Binary builds for several common platforms are available on our
   :doc:`downloads <bio-formats-downloads>` page.
-  See the :source:`build instructions <components/scifio/cppwrap/readme.txt>`
   (:source:`Windows </components/scifio/cppwrap/readme-windows.txt>`,
   :source:`Mac OS X <components/scifio/cppwrap/readme-macosx.txt>`,
   :source:`Linux <components/scifio/cppwrap/readme-linux.txt>`)
   for details on compiling from source.

Either way, once you have BF-CPP in compiled form, simply include it in
your project as you would any other external library.
