**Additional Information**


We strongly encourage users to export their .sld files to OME-TIFF 
using the SlideBook software.  Bio-Formats is not likely to support the full 
range of metadata that is included in .sld files, and so exporting to 
OME-TIFF from SlideBook is the best way to ensure that all metadata is 
preserved. 
Free software from 3i can export the files to OME-TIFF post-acquisition, see 
https://www.intelligent-imaging.com/slidebook.

3i also develops a native SlideBook reader which works with Bio-Formats. See 
http://www.openmicroscopy.org/info/slidebook for details.
