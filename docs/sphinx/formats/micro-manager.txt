**Additional Information**


- Bio-Formats will recognize a :file:`*metadata.txt` file as part of a
  Micro-Manager fileset if pointed at it and will load the fileset including
  the companion TIFF files.
- If pointed at a companion :file:`.ome.tif` file, Bio-Formats will recognize
  an OME-TIFF format instead. This means it may load the fileset if there are
  multiple .ome.tif but it will not include :file:`*metadata.txt` in this
  fileset and therefore the extended Micro-Manager metadata will be skipped.
- See :doc:`/users/micromanager/index` for more information.
