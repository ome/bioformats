Notes:


We strongly encourage users to export their .sld files to OME-TIFF 
using the SlideBook software.  Bio-Formats is not likely to support the full 
range of metadata that is included in .sld files, and so exporting to 
OME-TIFF from SlideBook is the best way to ensure that all metadata is 
preserved.
