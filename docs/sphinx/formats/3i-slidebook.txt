**Additional Information**



Notes:


We strongly encourage users to export their .sld files to OME-TIFF 
using the SlideBook software.  Bio-Formats is not likely to support the full 
range of metadata that is included in .sld files, and so exporting to 
OME-TIFF from SlideBook is the best way to ensure that all metadata is 
preserved. 
Free software from 3I can export the files to OME-TIFF post-acquisition, see 
https://www.slidebook.com/reader.php.

As of Bioformats 5.1.2 the native binary file SlideBook6Reader.dll
of the proper architecture (x32 or x64) must be in the java binary path for
this reader to work. This file is available from
`3i Support <mailto: support@intelligent-imaging.com>`_ and is currently
only available for Windows systems.
