Formats
=======

Bio-Formats supports over 120 different file formats. The :doc:`dataset-table` 
explains the file extension you should choose to open/import a dataset in any 
of these formats, while the :doc:`/supported-formats` table lists all of the 
formats and gives an indication of how well they are supported and whether 
Bio-Formats can write, as well as read, each format.

    Further information on each individual format is also provided (click on 
    the entries in the supported formats table).
