**Additional Information**


Source Code: :bfreader:`NativeND2Reader.java`

Notes:


There are two distinct versions of ND2: an old version, which uses 
JPEG-2000 compression, and a new version which is either uncompressed or 
Zip-compressed.  We are not aware of the version number or release date 
for either format. 

Bio-Formats uses the `JAI Image I/O Tools <http://java.net/projects/jai-imageio>`_ 
library to read ND2 files compressed with JPEG-2000. 

There is also an ND2 reader that uses Nikon's native libraries.  To use 
it, you must be using Windows and have `Nikon's ND2 reader plugin for ImageJ 
<http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/nd2-reader.html>`_ installed. 
Additionally, you will need to download :source:`LegacyND2Reader.dll 
<lib/LegacyND2Reader.dll?raw=true>` 
and place it in your ImageJ plugin folder.
