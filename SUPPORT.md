Before filing a bug report, please read and follow the
[guidance for bug reporting](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/latest/bio-formats/about/bug-reporting.html).

You can submit files to our [QA system](http://qa.openmicroscopy.org.uk/qa/upload/)
or for large files (>2 GB), please write to the
[OME Users mailing list](http://lists.openmicroscopy.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/ome-users)
and we will contact you privately with an FTP server address. If possible,
please submit a file we can make public for testing purposes. However, we will
keep files private on request.
